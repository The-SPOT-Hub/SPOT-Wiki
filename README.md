This is a place to:
- share all the materials that can be used to help to create engaging and interesting study sessions by both leads to organize study sessions and students who want self organize or practice on their own.
- find information about how to become a lead and the SPOT in general.

# SPOT Resources
Learning online can be isolating. Sometimes it’s hard to stay motivated without being connected to the people who are studying right a long with you. That’s why we’re here! The SPOT is a student-organized community for Launch School where we can come together, find study partners, participate in weekly study sessions, and find resources to help us in our path to mastery. You can find our Slack chanel at #the-spot.

# Weekly Study Sessions
At the heart of SPOT are the weekly study sessions for each course. These sessions are hosted by a volunteer student who has completed the course that they’re hosting. You can ask questions about the material and prepare for assessments together.

If you want to sign up to attend one, head over to #the-spot Slack chanel. We put up threads for each course every Thursday at around 9AM EDT/EST. All you have to do is add your availability to the provided LettuceMeet link (LettuceMeet is a scheduler) and/or leave a comment in the thread. If a Session Lead has volunteered to host a session that week, they'll determine what date and time the meeting will take place.

It’s important to remember that Session Leads are Launch School students too. What this means is that these sessions are not like the Launch School TA-lead sessions. Each Session Lead decides how they will manage and structure their own session. They might not have all the answers - and might not even be totally correct in their answers. They are also doing this on a volunteer basis, and may not be able to pick a date or time that fits everyone's schedule. We appreciate your understanding in this.

# Interested in Becoming a Session Lead?
If you’re interested in being a Lead and you’ve completed the course that you want to support, simply contact one of the SPOT Moderators. (You can find a list of currently active SPOT Mods in the channel description of #the-spot channel on Slack.) Let them know what course(s) you want to host sessions for and they'll onboard you with as much support and training as you want.

# Gather Town
Gather is a virtual meeting space that’s laid out like a 2D adventure game! This public space includes proximity video chat (where your camera and mic will connect with people who are nearby) and private rooms where your camera and mic will only connect with others in the area.

The SPOT’s [GatherTown](https://app.gather.town/app/8EeGq1YHbOo08Xso/launchschool) space has plenty of coding sandbox environments available for small and large groups alike (or just for yourself). You can code on your own or in front of others for that extra interview pressure. Look in the channel description for #the-spot to find the space’s password.

# The SPOT Community Guidlines
We want everyone here to have a good time while maintaining a conductive learning environment and we’re gonna need your help for that! To that end, here are our community guidelines:

1. Follow Launch School's [Student Code of Conduct](https://launchschool.com/code_of_conduct) and [Community GuideLines](https://launchschool.com/community_guidelines).
2. Along with that we emphasize that Session Leads _**will not answer any questions that pertain to the exact content of an assessment**_. We know that this can sometimes feel like a grey area. You won't be penalized for asking a question, but if the Session Lead says that they can't answer without violating the Code of Conduct then don't push the issue, or you will be reported.
