# Guide Discussion and Exploration

Start with topics that are foundational and dig into them in depth, rather than trying to cover everything.

Build up from "simple" concepts to more complicated ones. That way, beginners don't feel lost and more advanced students get practice with everything.

**Going over topics:**
These are all suggestions:

1. Do theory/concepts first and ensure everyone has a common understanding of a subject.
2. Go into examples next and relate it back to the concept.
3. Check in with students (or the ones that are more quiet/show body language of confusion) how they are doing and if anything is unclear.
4. Allow other students to practice answering (and you can keep track of any missing points to add, or reinforce key concepts).

**General pointers:**
1. Do less topics but go into depth. Do not be afraid of going back to concepts seen in previous lessons as this will help build a stronger foundation. This also allows you to share a complete mental model of a topic.
2. Have a timer somewhere to remind you when to end or close the session. You are welcome to stay longer than an hour if you wish.
3. If you have something that is too "large" to do in the group, like a mini project, have them post their answers in the group and let others comment during the week. This continuity is great for sharing a common mental model of a subject and working together to solidify concepts. Additionally, those who did not participate in the study group can also practice by answering questions.
4. Have fun. This is meant to be practice for you and the students.
