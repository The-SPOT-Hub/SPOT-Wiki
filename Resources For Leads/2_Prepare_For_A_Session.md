# Prepare For The Session

## You've Scheduled a Study Session, Now What?
Study groups will often have students at various stages of a course. It can help to prepare before to assist each student's learning.

It's useful to ask students to comment on a thread what they are struggling with or want to cover. This gives you an idea of what to expect level-wise.

## How to Prepare

### Use Resources You Used
Use resources you used while studying for that course (Study guide, codewars problems you've solved, notes, problem sets from blogs).

### Ask Students
1. Ask each student to bring a question or code snippet for the group to discuss.
2. Use the study guide as a tool for focusing discussion and finding challenging areas.

### Ask the SPOT mods or fellow leads
You can send a message to the current spot mods or another lead for tips how to to prepare.

## Approaches to the Study Session

**Quiz fundamental concepts while gradually building complexity:**

As for how to prepare and run the session, a lot of it is up to you and your individual style. Here's a general format:

1. Start with a warm welcome and a round of introductions. Try to set of friendly tone where people feel safe to ask questions and make mistakes. At the same time ask what lesson people are at or preparing for which assessment.
2. Based on their answers, you can start quizzing people on certain topics. For example, if some people are preparing for the written assessment and some are in the early course, you can ask the people preparing for the written assessment to explain a concept which people starting the course find difficult. For most of the session, you want the onus to think and explain to be on the students and not yourself, that way they practice explaining. Another advantage is that it exposes the flaws in their mental models which allows you to correct them by explaining the concept correctly, using a code example, or using a simile. Frequently prompt people if they have any questions or if an explanation was clear. Note that it's generally better to start asking questions for more fundamental concepts and gradually build up the complexity. If you start with complex stuff, you may find that there are gaps in people's more foundational knowledge and you will need to step back down.
3. If you passed the course assessment recently, people will want to hear about your experience and any tips you have for them. Make sure to include time for that, but avoid giving specific information about assessments.
4. Finally, keep track of time and be sure to stop ~5 minutes before the end of the session to ask people if they have any final questions and say farewells.
