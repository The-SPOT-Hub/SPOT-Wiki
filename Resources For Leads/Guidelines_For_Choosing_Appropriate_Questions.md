# Guidelines for choosing appropriate questions

## tl;dr
Don't share written quiz or interview assessment questions. Stick to questions from the SPOT Wiki, LSBot, and the course material.

## Don't:
- Don't use questions from the written quiz.
- Don't use questions from the interview assessment.
- Don't rewrite assessment questions by changing variable names or rephrasing the question. 
- Don't select questions from the course material that are very similar to assessment questions. This is a bit of a gray area, because students have access to the course material and some of the questions are quite similar to assessment questions but be mindful when using any course material.
- Don't select only questions/concepts that prepare students for assessments.

## Do:
- Conceptual questions are generally fine. If it's a question you can derive from the study guide and it's a fundamental concept, you can rephrase it without giving away that it's an assessment question.
- Help students master topics by covering fundamentals that aren't on the assessment.
- Keep conversation and questions general or vague: don't give away any specifics that would spoil assessments for other students.
- Use practice questions from the SPOT Wiki.
- Use LSBot to generate practice questions.

Overall, use your best judgement, and don't draw attention to questions that might be similar to assessment questions. If you're ever unsure about whether a question is okay or need more clarification, reach out to the SPOT Mods double-check.
