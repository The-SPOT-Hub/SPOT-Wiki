# Connect with & Adapt to Students

**Start of session**
1. Have a quick intro at the start of the session to welcome and integrate newcomers. If everyone already knows each other, just socialize a bit and catch up. This helps in setting the tone to the session. People can be nervous and this can help create a first connection between the group.
2. Start off by taking any new requests from participants or going over what you'll be covering today. This helps students understand where the most appropriate place to ask a questions will be.
