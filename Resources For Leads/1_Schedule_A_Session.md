# Schedule a Session

## 1. Sign up to lead a session
Each Thursday, weekly study sessions signups are posted in #the-spot channel.

Let the students know you will lead the course by commenting on the thread.

Here are some options to organize and schedule the session:

### A. Check the When2Meet for student availability:
Check the linked When2Meet for student availability that overlaps with your own. If you can't cover all students interested, post in #the-spot-leads channel to let us know, and we will look for another lead for the remaining students.

### B. Post your availability proactively:
If no students have added their availability to the When2Meet, you can kick things off by posting some days/times you are available to lead a session.

This can help get students involved who may be shy about being the first one to comment in the thread.
