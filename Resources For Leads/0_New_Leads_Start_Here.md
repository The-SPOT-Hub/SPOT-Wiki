# New Leads Start Here!

## Helpful Tips to Get Started
First of all, we'd like to thank you for taking your time to lead study sessions and give back to other students. You're awesome! ðŸŒŸ

As a reminder, being a lead is generous. You're free to lead study sessions when you want and stop organizing study sessions when you don't want.

It can take a few study sessions before you get comfortable with leading. So, an experienced lead will get in touch with you before your first study session as a lead. They'll be there to assist, answer your questions and give feedback on your first study session.

Have fun!

**What we are:**
- a place to review with students
- a place to overlearn and discuss topics with peers
- a place to build community

**What we aren't:**
- not a place for quality control of the information shared within a session
- not a place to track student performance or anything else
- not a place to receive compensation for volunteering

## Code Of Etiquette
As we grow, we'll all have a role to play in keeping this place chill and help integrate new students.

Our goal has always been to empower one another through peer-led sessions.

Whether strangers or friends, we've all got the same goal, mastery of the LS Curriculum.

As a **student**, this means:

1. Attend sessions for courses you are enrolled in or have completed
2. Allow people who are unsure of the answers to go first
3. Be considerate of those that haven't spoken and encourage them to practice within the group
4. Respect the volunteer leads and one another
5. Consider leading a discussion group or become a lead if you have aced an assessment

As a **lead**, this means:

1. Lead sessions for classes you have done well in
2. Inform students about how to access Gather and the Coderpads
3. Ensure students are at the right level or ask them to observe silently
4. Build collaboration by asking students to answer questions and refine the answers
5. Do not give answers away from assessments/quizzes
6. Support each student as they attempt to answer a question in public (this can be nerve-racking for some)

**Everyone:**
- Report anything that is against theÂ [code of conduct](https://launchschool.com/code_of_conduct)Â andÂ [community guidelines](https://launchschool.com/community_guidelines)


[#the-spot](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C017H333RDM) community will be what you make of it and how you nurture it.
