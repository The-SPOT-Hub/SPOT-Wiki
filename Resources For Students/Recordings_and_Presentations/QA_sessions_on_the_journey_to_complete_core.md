2. How are you and your wife dividing your time when Capstone starts for you? Is she doing all the housework, the kids and you're just focusing on Capstone?

3. What has worked for you schedule-wise?

4. Was inculcating unconscious habits something you were consciously working on?

5. How do you and your partner negotiate what's most important when you find you both want to work at the same time?

6. Capstone grad in the audience chimes in and Josh responds: "I had a teammate go through Capstone and did it while having kids. One thing Chris mentioned was the person was super efficient with their time... the efficiency you had to develop during Core might carry over."

7. Have you had a discussion with your partner about how things might change for Capstone?

8. Did you ever find it helpful to do flashcards or other studying during small moments of free time if your kids are unexpectedly entertaining themselves? Or is it more helpful to just have clear boundaries between study and family time?

9. How do you know you're giving your children and family enough of your time?

10. Tips tricks and wisdom on how you reviewed older material from previous modules as you progressed through the course? What's the percentage of time you spent in a given week revising old material?

11. Among your Capstone cohort, how are you grouped together into your project?

12. Josh closes the QA session by concluding on what motivated him to commit to the career transition and why thinking about the end goal is helpful.

1. Which of the later courses did you find most valuable?

2. Would you say that you've mastered all of the courses to the same level?

3. What differences did you experience between full-time and part-time study?

4. You mentioned motivation, roughly how long did it take you? Was there any point in the curriculum where you struggled a bit more than others, with motivation or with burnout?

5. Are there any topics or certain courses that you struggled with learning? Was there anything that was helpful to you when you were struggling?

6. You mentioned a few times about 170, 180. In that course they give you ideas for small projects... Did you do any little projects when you completed the backend courses? Or do you think it's a better idea to wait until you have all of the concepts down, then make a proper project with all of the different things you learned?

7. Did you have any issues with retention? I've seen medium articles from other students saying they got to the end of the course and forgot quite a lot of previous courses. Did you experience this? Do you have any strategies to make sure you retain the information long-term, so it doesn't just fade away?

8. Have you ever had to deal with doubt, negativity? How do you cope with negative feelings when going through Core?

9. I breakdown a key aspect of negative feelings when learning, feelings of boredom.

1. Do you apply PEDAC to literally every problem? Do you always use it?

2. Things takeup the amount of time you allocate to them. How do you reconcile Launch School's mastery-based curriculum pace with being goal-oriented and not having all the time in the world?

3. Quizzes in LS are very challenging. Is it an accurate marker of your understanding of the material at that point?

4. Are you continuing with Capstone soon? When did you start applying for your cohort? How long did it take you? How many hours/days were you putting in?

5. When you were working on the assignments, would you basically work on them from beginning to end until you finished and you wouldn't move on to the next lesson?

6. When do you think it's appropriate to have a code review?

7. Say you have an idea about a project that is not too sophisticated, but then again it's not too easy compared to what you've done. How do you determine whether it's something you can actually do? Something that won't discourage you very much, for someone at the beginning who doesn't have a lot of experience doing projects on their own?

8. You're at the last leg of your journey in Core. I'm sure you've tested different methods and tools... Was there anything you've tried before and you found that it didn't work and it was a waste of time? What worked for you? Have you tested things out?

9. You mentioned when you do a project, you have to at some point study something. How do you approach that? I feel so good in the LS environment... I fear that if I go out there again to learn something on my own I will be completely lost... How do you approach learning something outside the curriculum?

10. If you weren't doing Capstone, what would you do after Core or during Core in order to prepare yourself for the job?
