## Problem 8: GET vs POST HTTP Methods

Explain the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods and provide a use case for each.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- **GET** is used to request data from a specified resource. Data is appended to the URL as a query string. GET requests should be idempotent (repeating the request has no additional effect). A use case is retrieving a web page.
- **POST** is used to submit data to a server to create or update a resource. Data is sent in the request body, not the URL. POST requests are not idempotent. A use case is submitting a web form.
