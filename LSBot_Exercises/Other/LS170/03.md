## Problem 3: TCP vs UDP Protocols

Compare and contrast the TCP and UDP protocols. When might you choose one over the other?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees the reliable and ordered delivery of data. It uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection and includes mechanisms for error-checking and flow control. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a simpler, connectionless protocol that offers faster but unreliable data transfer, without guarantees of delivery or order. TCP is used for applications where data integrity is crucial (e.g., web browsing, email), while UDP is suitable for applications where speed is more important than reliability (e.g., video streaming, online gaming).
