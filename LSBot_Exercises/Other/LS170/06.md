## Problem 6: URL Encoding

What is URL encoding and why is it necessary?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

URL encoding (or percent-encoding) is the process of converting characters that are not allowed in a URL into a valid format. It replaces a character with a `%` sign followed by two hexadecimal digits representing its ASCII value. This is necessary because URLs can only contain a specific set of characters, and some characters have special meanings within the URL structure (e.g., `?`, `&`, `/`). Encoding ensures that the URL is transmitted and interpreted correctly.
