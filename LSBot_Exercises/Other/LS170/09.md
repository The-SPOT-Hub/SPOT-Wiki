<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The three main services provided by TLS (Transport Layer Security) are:

- **Encryption:** Ensures data confidentiality by encoding messages so they can only be read by authorized parties.
- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the server using digital certificates, preventing impersonation.
- **Integrity:** Guarantees that messages have not been altered or tampered with during transit, typically using a Message Authentication Code (MAC).
