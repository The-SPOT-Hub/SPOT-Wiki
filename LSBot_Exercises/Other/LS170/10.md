## Problem 10: TLS Chain of Trust

What is the "chain of trust" in the context of TLS digital certificates?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The "chain of trust" is the method by which a browser verifies the authenticity of a server's digital certificate. The server's certificate is signed by an Intermediate Certificate Authority (CA), which is in turn signed by a trusted Root CA. Browsers and operating systems maintain a list of these trusted Root CAs. By following the chain of signatures from the server's certificate back to a trusted root, the browser can confirm that the certificate is legitimate.
