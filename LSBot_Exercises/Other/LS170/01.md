<summary>Solution:</summary>

The client-server model is an application structure that divides tasks between servers, which provide a resource or service, and clients, which request it. In web interactions, a client (like a web browser) sends a request to a server for a resource. The server processes this request and sends back a response. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol that governs this communication, defining the format of requests and responses so that clients and servers can understand each other.
