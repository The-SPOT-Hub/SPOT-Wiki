## Problem 7: INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN

**Conceptual**: What is the difference between an `INNER JOIN` and a `LEFT JOIN`? Provide a simple scenario where you would choose one over the other.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where the join condition is met in **both** tables. A `LEFT JOIN` returns **all** rows from the left table, and only the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the columns from the right table will be `NULL`.

**Scenario**: If you want to find all customers who have placed an order, you would use an `INNER JOIN` between `customers` and `orders`. If you wanted to find all customers, *including those who have never placed an order*, you would use a `LEFT JOIN` with `customers` as the left table.
