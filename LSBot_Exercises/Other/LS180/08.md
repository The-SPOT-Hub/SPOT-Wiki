## Problem 8: Adding CHECK Constraints

**Coding**: You have a table named `films` with a column `release_year` of type `INTEGER`. Write a DDL statement to add a `CHECK` constraint to this table that ensures the `release_year` is always 1900 or later.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE films
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_release_year CHECK (release_year >= 1900);
```

</details>
