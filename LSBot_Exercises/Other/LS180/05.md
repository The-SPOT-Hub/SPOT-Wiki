## Problem 5: Surrogate vs Natural Keys

**Conceptual**: Explain the difference between a surrogate key and a natural key. What are the advantages of using a surrogate key?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A **natural key** is a key made from attributes that already exist in the real world and have business meaning (e.g., a social security number or email address). A **surrogate key** is an artificial key with no business meaning, usually an auto-incrementing integer, created solely to act as the primary key.

The main advantage of a surrogate key is stability. Since it has no business meaning, it will never need to be changed. Natural keys can sometimes change (e.g., a person changes their name or email address), which can cause complex update cascades throughout the database.
