## Problem 9: CSS Positioning

Explain the difference between `position: relative`, `position: absolute`, and `position: fixed`.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

- **position: relative**: The element is positioned according to the normal document flow. You can then use offset properties (top, left, etc.) to move it relative to its normal position without affecting the layout of other elements. It also serves as a positioning context for absolutely positioned child elements.
- **position: absolute**: The element is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element whose position is not static). If no such ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
- **position: fixed**: The element is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to the browser's viewport. It will stay in the same position on the screen even when the page is scrolled.
