<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `<label>` element provides a descriptive caption for a form control. Associating a label with an input is crucial for accessibility, as screen readers use it to announce what the form control is for. It also provides a larger clickable area for the user to activate the input field.

The two ways to associate them are:

- **Implicitly**: by nesting the `<input>` element inside the `<label>` element.
- **Explicitly**: by giving the `<input>` an id attribute and setting the for attribute on the `<label>` to the same value as the input's id.
