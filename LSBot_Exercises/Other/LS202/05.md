## Problem 5: Visual Formatting Model

Explain the key differences between elements with `display: block`, `display: inline`, and `display: inline-block`.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- **display: block**: The element starts on a new line and takes up the full width available to it. You can set width, height, margin, and padding on block elements.
- **display: inline**: The element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content requires. You cannot set a width or height, and vertical margins and padding are not respected in the layout.
- **display: inline-block**: The element is formatted inline (it does not start on a new line) but you can set a width and height, and it respects vertical margins and padding, similar to a block element.
