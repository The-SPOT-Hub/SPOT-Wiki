<summary>Solution:</summary>

The four components of the box model, from innermost to outermost, are:

- **Content**: The area where the text and images appear.
- **Padding**: The transparent area around the content, inside the border.
- **Border**: A border that goes around the padding and content.
- **Margin**: The transparent area outside the border, which separates the element from other elements.

The difference between box-sizing models lies in how the element's total width and height are calculated:

- **content-box (default)**: The width and height properties apply only to the content area. Padding and border are added outside this width and height, increasing the element's total size.
- **border-box**: The width and height properties include the content, padding, and border. This makes layout calculations more predictable, as the element's rendered size will match the specified width and height.
