## Problem 10: Extending Types

Given the two interfaces `ContactInfo` and `AddressInfo`, create a new type `EmployeeProfile` that includes all properties from both, plus an additional `employeeId` of type number. Demonstrate how to create an object of this new type.

```typescript
// Starting interfaces
interface ContactInfo {
  email: string;
  phone: string;
}

interface AddressInfo {
  street: string;
  city: string;
  postalCode: string;
}
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

You can create the new type using an intersection (`&`).

```typescript
// Using an intersection type to combine them
type EmployeeProfile = ContactInfo & AddressInfo & {
  employeeId: number;
};

// Example object creation:
const employee: EmployeeProfile = {
  employeeId: 42,
  email: "employee@example.com",
  phone: "555-123-4567",
  street: "123 Main St",
  city: "Anytown",
  postalCode: "12345",
};

console.log(employee);
```

**Key concepts:**
- **Intersection types** (`&`) combine multiple types into one
- All properties from `ContactInfo`, `AddressInfo`, and the additional `employeeId` are required
- The resulting type ensures type safety for all combined properties
- This approach is more flexible than inheritance and works well for combining interfaces
