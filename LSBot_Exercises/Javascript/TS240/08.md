## Problem 8: Type Assertions Debugging

A developer is fetching data from an API and using a type assertion to tell TypeScript the shape of the data. What is the potential danger in the following code, and how could you make it safer?

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

// Assume fetchData returns a Promise<any>
async function getProduct(productId: string): Promise<Product> {
  const response = await fetchData(`/api/products/${productId}`);
  // What is the risk with this assertion?
  const product = response as Product; 
  return product;
}
```

**Potential Danger:**

The danger of `response as Product` is that it's purely a build-time instruction to the TypeScript compiler. It tells the compiler, "Trust me, this response object has the shape of a Product," but it performs no actual validation on the data at run time. If the API returns data in an unexpected format (e.g., price is a string, name is missing, or the entire response is null), the product variable will not match the Product type, which can lead to run-time errors later in the code that are hard to trace.

**Safer Alternative:**

A safer approach is to perform run-time validation on the unknown response to ensure it matches the expected type. This can be done with a type guard function.

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

// Type guard function to validate the structure at run time
function isProduct(data: unknown): data is Product {
  if (typeof data !== 'object' || data === null) {
    return false;
  }
  
  const p = data as Product;
  return (
    typeof p.id === 'string' &&
    typeof p.name === 'string' &&
    typeof p.price === 'number'
  );
}

async function getProduct(productId: string): Promise<Product> {
  const response: unknown = await fetchData(`/api/products/${productId}`);

  if (isProduct(response)) {
    // Now TypeScript knows 'response' is a Product inside this block
    return response; 
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the data is invalid
    throw new Error("Invalid product data received from API.");
  }
}
```

The type guard approach provides runtime validation and ensures that the data actually matches the expected structure before using it.
