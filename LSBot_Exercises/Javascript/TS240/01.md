## Problem 1: Build Time vs. Run Time

In the context of TypeScript, explain the difference between build-time errors and run-time errors. Provide a simple code example for each type of error.

**Build-time errors** (also called compile-time errors) are detected by the TypeScript compiler (tsc) before the code is executed. These errors relate to type mismatches, syntax errors, or violations of TypeScript's rules. They prevent the JavaScript code from being generated.

**Run-time errors** occur after the code has been compiled to JavaScript and is being executed by a JavaScript engine (like a browser or Node.js). These are errors that TypeScript's static analysis cannot predict, such as logic errors, accessing properties of null or undefined, or issues with external data/APIs.

**Build-Time Error Example:**
```typescript
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
message = 123; // Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```
This code will cause a build-time error because you cannot assign a number to a variable explicitly typed as a string. The TypeScript compiler will report this error before any JavaScript file is created.

**Run-Time Error Example:**
```typescript
function processResponse(apiResponse: any) {
  // This might throw a run-time error if apiResponse.data is null or undefined
  console.log(apiResponse.data.name); 
}

// Simulating a faulty API response
processResponse({ data: null });
```
This code will compile successfully because TypeScript doesn't know what `apiResponse.data` will be. However, if the API returns null, trying to access the name property will cause a run-time error (TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')).
