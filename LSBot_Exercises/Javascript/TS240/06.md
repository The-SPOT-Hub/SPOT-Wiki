## Problem 6: Structural Typing

TypeScript uses a structural type system. Explain what this means and provide a code example that demonstrates how structural typing allows two objects created from different types to be considered compatible.

A **structural type system** (also known as "duck typing") determines type compatibility based on the shape or structure of an objectâ€”that is, the names and types of its properties. If an object has at least the same properties with the same types as another type, it is considered compatible. This is different from a nominal type system (used in languages like Java or C#), where types are only compatible if they share the same explicit name or declaration.

**Example demonstrating structural typing:**

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

class Customer {
  constructor(public name: string, public accountId: number) {}
}

function logPersonName(person: Person): void {
  console.log(person.name);
}

const myPerson: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const myCustomer = new Customer("Bob", 12345);

logPersonName(myPerson); // Works, `myPerson` matches the `Person` structure.
logPersonName(myCustomer); // Works, `myCustomer` has a `name: string` property, satisfying the structure.
```

In this example, the `logPersonName` function expects an object with a `name` property of type `string`. The `myCustomer` object fits this structure, so TypeScript allows it to be passed to the function, even though `myCustomer` was created from the `Customer` class and not the `Person` interface. This demonstrates how structural typing focuses on the shape of objects rather than their explicit type declarations.
