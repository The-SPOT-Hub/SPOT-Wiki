## Problem 2: any, unknown, and never

Describe the key differences between the special types `any`, `unknown`, and `never`. For what specific scenario is `unknown` a safer choice than `any`?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**`any`**: This type effectively opts out of TypeScript's type-checking system. You can assign any value to a variable of type `any`, and you can access any property or call any method on it without the compiler complaining. It provides maximum flexibility but sacrifices type safety.

**`unknown`**: This is the type-safe counterpart to `any`. You can assign any value to a variable of type `unknown`, but you cannot perform any operations on it (like accessing properties or calling methods) until you first narrow its type using a type guard (e.g., `typeof`, `instanceof`) or a type assertion.

**`never`**: This type represents a value that will never occur. It's typically used as the return type for functions that always throw an error or have an infinite loop, meaning they never return a value.

**Safer `unknown` Scenario:**

`unknown` is safer than `any` when dealing with data from external sources like APIs, user input, or third-party libraries where the type is not guaranteed.

**Example demonstrating the difference:**

```typescript
// Unsafe with 'any'
function processDataAny(data: any) {
  // No error at build time, but this could easily crash at run time
  // if 'data' is not an object with a 'toUpperCase' method.
  console.log(data.name.toUpperCase()); 
}

// Safe with 'unknown'
function processDataUnknown(data: unknown) {
  // The line below causes a build-time error: 'data' is of type 'unknown'.
  // console.log(data.name.toUpperCase()); 

  // We are forced to check the type before using it.
  if (typeof data === 'object' && data !== null && 'name' in data && typeof (data as any).name === 'string') {
    console.log((data as any).name.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```

The `unknown` approach forces you to perform type checking before using the data, preventing runtime errors that could occur with `any`.
