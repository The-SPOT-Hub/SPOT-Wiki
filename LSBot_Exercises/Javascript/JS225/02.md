## Problem 2: Closures and Private Data

Create a function `makeCounter` that uses a closure to maintain a private counter. The function should return an object with two methods: `increment`, which increases the counter by one, and `getCount`, which returns the current value of the counter.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0; // This variable is private to the returned object's methods

  return {
    increment: function() {
      count += 1;
    },
    getCount: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const counter1 = makeCounter();
counter1.increment();
counter1.increment();
console.log(counter1.getCount()); // => 2

const counter2 = makeCounter();
console.log(counter2.getCount()); // => 0
```

</details>
