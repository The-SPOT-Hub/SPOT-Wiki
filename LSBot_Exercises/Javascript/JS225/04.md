## Problem 4: Prototypal Inheritance

Describe what prototypal inheritance is in JavaScript. How does it differ from the classical inheritance model found in languages like Java or Ruby?

**Prototypal Inheritance:** In JavaScript, objects can directly inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every object has an internal property (`[[Prototype]]`) that links to another object, called its "prototype." When you try to access a property on an object, the JavaScript engine first checks the object itself. If the property is not found, it travels up the "prototype chain" to the prototype object and checks there. This continues until the property is found or the end of the chain is reached (null). This mechanism is also known as behavior delegation.

**Difference from Classical Inheritance:**

- **Classical inheritance** is based on classes, which act as blueprints for objects. A class inherits from another class.
- **Prototypal inheritance** is based on objects inheriting from other objects. The relationship is between object instances, not blueprints.
- **Classical inheritance** often creates copies of functionality in new instances, whereas **prototypal inheritance** links to a single shared prototype object, which is more memory-friendly.
