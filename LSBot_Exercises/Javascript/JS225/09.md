## Problem 9: Garbage Collection and Closures

Explain how garbage collection works in relation to closures in JavaScript. Specifically, when does a variable that is part of a closure become eligible for garbage collection?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A closure keeps variables from its outer scope "alive" by maintaining a reference to them, even after the outer function has finished executing. The JavaScript engine's garbage collector identifies and reclaims memory that is no longer reachable from the root of the program (e.g., the global object).

Because a closure holds a reference to its surrounding state (the variables it "closes over"), the garbage collector considers those variables "reachable" and will not deallocate their memory.

A variable held in a closure becomes eligible for garbage collection only when the closure itself is no longer reachable. If all references to the inner function (the closure) are gone (e.g., the variable holding the function is reassigned or goes out of scope), the closure can be garbage collected. At that point, the variables it was referencing can also be collected, provided no other part of the program can reach them.
