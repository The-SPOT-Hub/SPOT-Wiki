## Problem 6: IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), and what are two common use cases for it?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Definition:** An IIFE is a JavaScript function that is executed as soon as it is defined. It is created by wrapping a function expression in parentheses `()` to tell the parser to treat it as an expression, and then immediately calling it with a second pair of parentheses `()`.

**Use Case 1: Creating Private Scope** - It creates a new scope for variables, preventing them from leaking into the global scope. This helps avoid naming collisions and keeps the global namespace clean.

```javascript
(function() {
  var secret = 'I am private'; // Not accessible globally
  console.log('IIFE executed');
})();
// console.log(secret); // ReferenceError: secret is not defined
```

**Use Case 2: The Module Pattern** - An IIFE can return an object that exposes a public interface (API) while keeping its internal state and implementation details private. This is achieved through closures.

```javascript
const myModule = (function() {
  let privateVar = 'secret';

  function privateMethod() {
    console.log(privateVar);
  }

  return {
    publicMethod: function() {
      privateMethod();
    }
  };
})();

myModule.publicMethod(); // logs 'secret'
// myModule.privateMethod(); // TypeError: myModule.privateMethod is not a function
```
