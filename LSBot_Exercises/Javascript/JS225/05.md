## Problem 5: ES6 Class Syntax and Inheritance

Using ES6 class syntax, create a `Person` class with a constructor that takes `name` and `age`. It should have a method `introduce()` that returns a string like "Hi, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old." Then, create a `Student` class that inherits from `Person`. The `Student` constructor should also take a `major`, and it should override the `introduce()` method to return a string like "Hi, my name is [name], I am [age] years old, and I am majoring in [major]."

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  introduce() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, major) {
    super(name, age); // Calls the parent constructor
    this.major = major;
  }

  introduce() {
    // Calls the parent's introduce method and extends it
    return `${super.introduce()} I am majoring in ${this.major}.`;
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(person1.introduce()); // => "Hi, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."

const student1 = new Student('Bob', 22, 'Computer Science');
console.log(student1.introduce()); // => "Hi, my name is Bob, I am 22 years old, and I am majoring in Computer Science."
```
