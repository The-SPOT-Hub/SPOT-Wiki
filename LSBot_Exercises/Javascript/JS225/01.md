## Problem 1: Function Execution Context

Explain the difference between implicit and explicit function execution context in JavaScript. Provide a simple code example for each.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Implicit execution context** is determined automatically by how a function is invoked. When a function is called as a method on an object (e.g., `myObj.myMethod()`), its execution context (`this`) is implicitly set to the object it was called on (`myObj`). If a function is called as a standalone function (e.g., `myFunction()`), its context is the global object (window in browsers) or undefined in strict mode.

```javascript
// Implicit Context Example
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

person.greet(); // `this` is implicitly `person`. Output: "Hello, I'm Alice."
```

**Explicit execution context** is when you manually set the value of `this` for a function's execution, overriding the implicit context. This is done using the methods `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`.

```javascript
// Explicit Context Example
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}.`);
}

const alice = { name: 'Alice' };
const bob = { name: 'Bob' };

greet.call(bob); // `this` is explicitly `bob`. Output: "Hello, I'm Bob."
```
