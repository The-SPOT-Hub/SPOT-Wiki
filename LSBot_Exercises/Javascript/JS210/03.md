## Problem 3: Temporal Dead Zone

What will the following code log to the console and why?

```javascript
let a = 'first';

function scopeTest() {
  console.log(a);
  let a = 'second';
}

scopeTest();
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The code will throw a `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization`.

Inside the `scopeTest` function, the `let a` declaration is hoisted to the top of the function's scope, but it is not initialized. This creates a "temporal dead zone". When `console.log(a)` is executed, it tries to access the function-scoped `a` which has not yet been initialized. This results in a `ReferenceError`. The `a` in the outer scope is shadowed by the inner `a` and is therefore not accessible from within the function.
