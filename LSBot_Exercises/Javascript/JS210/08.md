## Problem 8: Primitive Values vs Objects

Explain the difference between primitive values and objects in JavaScript, especially concerning how they are stored and passed to functions.

**Primitive Values:** There are 7 primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint). They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. When a primitive value is assigned to a variable or passed to a function, a copy of the value is created and used.

**Objects:** Objects (which include arrays and functions) are mutable. When an object is assigned to a variable or passed to a function, a copy of the reference (the memory address) to the object is created and used. Because multiple variables can hold a reference to the same object, modifying the object through one variable will be visible through all other variables that reference it.
