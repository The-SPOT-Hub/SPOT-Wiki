## Problem 4: Object Reference vs Value

What does the following code output? Explain your reasoning.

```javascript
function changeStuff(arr, obj) {
  arr[0] = 'hi';
  obj.name = 'Bob';
}

let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
let person = { name: 'Alice' };

changeStuff(letters, person);

console.log(letters);
console.log(person);
```

**Output:**

```javascript
[ 'hi', 'b', 'c' ]
{ name: 'Bob' }
```

**Reasoning:** In JavaScript, objects (including arrays) are passed to functions by passing a copy of the reference. This means both the original variable (`letters`, `person`) and the function parameter (`arr`, `obj`) point to the same object in memory. When the function mutates the object or array using its parameter, the changes are visible outside the function because the underlying object itself has been modified.
