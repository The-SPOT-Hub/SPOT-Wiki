## Problem 1: Loose vs Strict Equality

Explain the difference between loose equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`) in JavaScript. Provide an example where they produce different results.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The strict equality operator (`===`) checks for equality without performing type conversion. If the operands have different types, it immediately returns false. It compares both the value and the type.

The loose equality operator (`==`) performs type coercion if the operands are of different types before making the comparison.

**Example:**

```javascript
5 == "5"   // true (string "5" is coerced to number 5)
5 === "5"  // false (operands have different types: number and string)
```
