## Problem 2: JavaScript Hoisting

What is hoisting in JavaScript? Explain how it applies to variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const`, as well as to function declarations.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

- **var**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with the value `undefined`. They can be accessed before their declaration without an error, but their value will be `undefined`.
- **let and const**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but are not initialized. They exist in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the scope until their declaration is encountered. Accessing them before they are declared results in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Function Declarations**: These are fully hoisted, meaning both the function's name and its body are moved to the top of the scope. You can call a function declaration before it physically appears in the code.
