## Problem 28: Mutation vs Non-Mutation

```js
let m = ["foo"];
let n = ["bar"];
let o = m;
o = o.concat(n);

console.log(m, n, o);

// What will line 6 output and why?

m = ["foo"];
n = ["bar"];
o = m;
o.push(n[0]);

console.log(m, n, o);

// Now, what will be output and why?
// What's the difference?
```

### Bonus Questions
1. How many arrays will have been created in this code snippet? What are they?
2. What operations create new objects in this snippet?
3. Does commenting out the first 6 lines have any effect on the last output, `console.log(m, n, o)`? Why or why not?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```js
console.log(m, n, o);  // ["foo"] ["bar"] ["foo", "bar"]

console.log(m, n, o);  // ["foo", "bar"] ["bar"] ["foo", "bar"]
```

**Explanation:**
In the first section, `concat` is a non-mutating method that returns a new array. So `o` is reassigned to reference a new array containing elements from both `m` and `n`, while `m` remains unchanged.

In the second section, `push` is a mutating method. Since `o` references the same array as `m`, using `push` on `o` mutates the shared array, affecting both `m` and `o`.

**Bonus Questions:**
1. 5 arrays total:
   - `["foo"]` (first `m`)
   - `["bar"]` (first `n`)
   - `["foo", "bar"]` (created by `concat`)
   - `["foo"]` (second `m`)
   - `["bar"]` (second `n`)

2. The array literals (`["foo"]`, `["bar"]`) and the `concat` method create new objects.

3. No, commenting out the first 6 lines has no effect on the last output. The variables are reassigned on lines 8-9, completely replacing their previous values. Variables don't retain history; they only reference their current values.
