## Problem 101: Identifying Concepts

What things can we consider when deciding what concept is being demonstrated by a snippet?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

When identifying what concept a snippet demonstrates, consider:

**1. What is surprising or non-obvious?**
- Look for behavior that might be unexpected or that requires understanding of a specific concept
- The "interesting" part of the code often reveals the concept

**2. What would someone need to know to predict the output?**
- The knowledge required to correctly predict what happens is usually the concept being demonstrated
- If you need to understand X to explain Y, then X is likely the concept

**3. What is the focus of the code?**
- Where is the code doing something specific or unique?
- What aspect of the code would you need to change to get different behavior?

**4. What mistakes might someone make without understanding this concept?**
- If understanding the concept prevents a common error, that's a good indicator
- The concept often explains why something doesn't work the way a beginner might expect

**5. What similar code would behave differently?**
- Small changes that produce big differences often highlight the concept
- The minimal change that alters behavior reveals what matters

**6. Look at the structure and keywords:**
- Function parameters → might demonstrate scope, shadowing, or pass-by-reference/value
- Mutations vs reassignments → might demonstrate mutability
- Nested blocks → might demonstrate scope or shadowing
- Object/array operations → might demonstrate references or mutability

**Example process:**

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
function modify(arr) {
  arr = [4, 5, 6];
}
modify(arr);
console.log(arr);  // [1, 2, 3]
```

- **Surprising?** Yes - the array wasn't modified even though we changed it in the function
- **What do you need to know?** That reassignment doesn't affect the original when working with parameters
- **Focus?** The parameter reassignment and its lack of effect
- **Common mistake?** Expecting the array to change because functions can mutate objects
- **Concept:** Pass-by-value-of-the-reference (or reassignment vs mutation)
