## Problem 40: Things That Aren't Expressions

What are some things in JavaScript that *aren't* expressions?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

All statements listed in the [MDN Statements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements). Examples include:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `if`/`else` statements
- `switch` statements
- Variable declarations (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Function declarations
- `return` statements
- `break` and `continue` statements
- `try`/`catch` blocks
- `throw` statements

These are statements that perform actions but don't themselves evaluate to values. However, they often contain expressions as part of their syntax:

```js
if (x > 5) {         // `if` is a statement, `x > 5` is an expression
  return x * 2;      // `return` is a statement, `x * 2` is an expression
}
```
