## Problem 78: Shadowing as Tool or Pitfall

Is variable shadowing a tool we can use, or something we need to be aware of to avoid?

<details>

Both. Variable shadowing is a natural consequence of JavaScript's scoping rules that can be used intentionally, but it's also something to be aware of to avoid bugs.

**As a tool (intentional use):**

Sometimes shadowing is useful and makes code clearer:

```js
// Using common parameter names without worrying about outer variables
let data = fetchGlobalData();

function processUser(data) {  // Intentionally use 'data' for user data
  // Work with user data, not global data
  return data.name.toUpperCase();
}

// Loop variables commonly shadow
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // It's fine that other 'i' variables exist elsewhere
}
```

**As a pitfall (unintentional bugs):**

```js
let total = 0;

function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;  // Oops! Shadows outer 'total' - might be unintentional
  for (let item of items) {
    total += item.price;
  }
  // Outer 'total' is unchanged!
}

calculateTotal([{price: 10}, {price: 20}]);
console.log(total);  // Still 0 - probably not what we wanted
```

**Best practices:**

1. **Be intentional** - Know when you're shadowing and why
2. **Use descriptive names** - Avoid reusing generic names like `data`, `value`, `item` at multiple levels
3. **Pay attention to parameters** - Remember they can shadow outer variables
4. **Use linters** - Tools can warn you about accidental shadowing
5. **When in doubt, use different names** - It's usually clearer

Shadowing itself isn't bad, but accidental shadowing is a common source of bugs. Be deliberate about when and why you're reusing variable names.
