## Problem 99: Reverse Array In Place

Given an array, reverse the elements of the array *in place*. You may not use any additional arrays.

**Hint:** If you can't figure out where to start, try creating the function to work with arrays of a fixed length, like 4 elements or 6.

Think about swapping elements from opposite ends of the array. You only need to iterate through half the array, swapping the first element with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.

```js
function reverse(arr) {
  for (let idx = 0; idx < arr.length / 2; idx += 1) {
    let currentElem = arr[idx];
    let oppositeElem = arr[arr.length - idx - 1];
    arr[idx] = oppositeElem;
    arr[arr.length - idx - 1] = currentElem;
  }
}

// Alternative using destructuring
function reverse(arr) {
  for (let idx = 0; idx < arr.length / 2; idx += 1) {
    let oppositeIdx = arr.length - idx - 1;
    [arr[idx], arr[oppositeIdx]] = [arr[oppositeIdx], arr[idx]];
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The key insight is that we only need to iterate through half the array. For each element in the first half, we swap it with its corresponding element in the second half:

```
Initial: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
         
Iteration 0: idx = 0, opposite = 4
  Swap arr[0] and arr[4]: [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]

Iteration 1: idx = 1, opposite = 3
  Swap arr[1] and arr[3]: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Stop at idx = 2 (halfway point)
```

**Why `arr.length / 2`?**
- If we went to `arr.length`, we'd swap everything twice (back to original)
- For odd-length arrays, the middle element stays in place (correct)
- For even-length arrays, we swap each pair exactly once (correct)

**Testing:**

```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
reverse(arr1);
console.log(arr1);  // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

let arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
reverse(arr2);
console.log(arr2);  // [4, 3, 2, 1]

let arr3 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
reverse(arr3);
console.log(arr3);  // ['c', 'b', 'a']
```

**Note:** JavaScript arrays have a built-in `reverse()` method that does this, but implementing it ourselves helps understand in-place algorithms and array manipulation.
