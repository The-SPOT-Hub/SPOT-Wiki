## Problem 85: Shadowing in Loops

A friend shows you their broken code and asks for help understanding why it's not working. How do you explain the error being thrown?

```js
let snack = 'french fries';
let num = 1;

while (num < 3) {
  let num = num + 1;
  console.log(`I'll love ${snack}, even when I'm ${num * 100}!`);
}
```

### Bonus Questions
1. How can we fix this code?
2. How does our error change if we get rid of our `while` loop and decide we only want to print our message once?
3. Most `for` loops that we see use `let` like so: `for (let x = 0; x...)`. Can we use a `for` loop to fix this code and still use the `num` variable created on line 2?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The error is: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'num' before initialization`

**Explanation:**

On line 5, `let num = num + 1;` attempts to:
1. Declare a new block-scoped variable `num` (because of `let`)
2. Initialize it with `num + 1`

The problem is that JavaScript sees the `let num` declaration and creates the new variable in the block scope, which shadows the outer `num`. But when trying to evaluate `num + 1` on the right side, it tries to use the new `num` before it's been initialized (the initialization is the part after `=`). This creates a Temporal Dead Zone violation.

The new `num` exists but isn't initialized yet, and it shadows the outer `num`, so we can't access either.

**Bonus Questions:**

1. Remove `let` within the loop:
```js
let snack = 'french fries';
let num = 1;

while (num < 3) {
  num = num + 1;  // No 'let' - reassigns outer num
  console.log(`I'll love ${snack}, even when I'm ${num * 100}!`);
}
```

2. We get a `SyntaxError: Identifier 'num' has already been declared`:
```js
let snack = 'french fries';
let num = 1;

let num = num + 1;  // SyntaxError
console.log(`I'll love ${snack}, even when I'm ${num * 100}!`);
```
Without the block scope from the loop, we're trying to re-declare `num` in the same scope, which is not allowed with `let`.

3. Yes, we can use a `for` loop:
```js
let snack = 'french fries';
let num = 1;

for (; num < 3; num += 1) {  // Use outer num, no new declaration
  console.log(`I'll love ${snack}, even when I'm ${num * 100}!`);
}

// Or if we want to use it more traditionally:
for (; num < 3;) {
  num = num + 1;
  console.log(`I'll love ${snack}, even when I'm ${num * 100}!`);
}
```

The key is to omit the initialization part of the `for` loop and use the existing `num` variable.
