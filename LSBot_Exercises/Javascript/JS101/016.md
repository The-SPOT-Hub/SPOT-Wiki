## Problem 16: String Interpolation

Can you write the code necessary to get the desired output shown on the last line? Write two distinct solutions and explain the tools each uses.

```js
let make = 'Ford';
let model = 'Ranger';
let year = 1995;

let sentence = ???

console.log(sentence);
// Look! It's a 1995 Ford Ranger!
```

### Bonus Questions
1. Is there any type of coercion happening in this code?
2. If we change the values referenced by `make`, `model`, or `year` after `sentence` has been initialized, will the sentence be updated?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```js
// Solution 1: Template literals
let sentence = `Look! It's a ${year} ${make} ${model}!`;

// Solution 2: String concatenation
let sentence = "Look! It's a " + year + " " + make + " " + model + "!";
```

**Explanation:**
- Template literals use backticks and `${}` to embed expressions
- String concatenation uses the `+` operator to join strings

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Yes, the `year` variable (a number) is coerced to a string in both solutions.
2. No. Once `sentence` is initialized with the string value, it holds that specific string. Changing the original variables won't affect `sentence` because strings are primitive values.
