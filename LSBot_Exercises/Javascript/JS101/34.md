## Problem 34: Things Without Truthiness

What are some things in JavaScript that *don't* have truthiness?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Keywords and statements, such as `return`, `let`, `while`, `for`, `if`, `const`, `function`, etc.

These don't have truthiness because they aren't values - they're part of JavaScript's syntax. You can't evaluate them in a boolean context because they don't produce values themselves.

For example, you can't do:
```js
if (return) { ... }  // Syntax error
if (let) { ... }     // Syntax error
```

Only values (or expressions that evaluate to values) have truthiness.
