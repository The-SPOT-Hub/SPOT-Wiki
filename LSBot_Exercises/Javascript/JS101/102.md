## Problem 102: Multiple Concepts

What do we do if a snippet is demonstrating multiple concepts?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

When a snippet demonstrates multiple concepts, identify all of them and explain them in order of importance or relevance:

**1. Identify the primary concept(s)**
- What is the main point or the most important thing to understand?
- What concept is most essential for predicting the behavior?

**2. Identify secondary concepts**
- What supporting concepts are also at play?
- What foundational knowledge is being used but isn't the focus?

**3. Prioritize by:**
- **Relevance to the question** - If asked "what does this demonstrate," focus on the most distinctive or interesting concept
- **Order of execution** - Sometimes explaining in chronological order makes sense
- **Dependency** - Explain prerequisites before building on them
- **Prominence** - The concept most prominently featured is often primary

**Example:**

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let person = { nums: numbers };

numbers.push(4);
console.log(person.nums);  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Multiple concepts present:**
1. **Variables as pointers** (primary) - `person.nums` and `numbers` reference the same array
2. **Mutability** (primary) - The array is mutated via `push`
3. Object property access (secondary/foundational)
4. Array methods (secondary/foundational)

**How to explain:**
"This snippet primarily demonstrates (1) **variables as pointers** and (2) **mutability**. The variable `person.nums` and the variable `numbers` both reference the same array object. When we mutate that array using `push`, the change is visible through both variables because they point to the same object."

**Guidelines:**
- List 1-3 main concepts (listing too many dilutes your answer)
- Distinguish between "concepts being demonstrated" and "concepts being used"
- Using variables, calling methods, and basic operations are usually not what's being demonstrated
- Focus on what makes the snippet interesting or educational

**When in doubt:**
Ask yourself: "If I changed X, would the behavior change significantly?" If yes, X is probably a concept being demonstrated.
