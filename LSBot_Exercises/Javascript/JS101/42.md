## Problem 42: Assignment in Conditional

Explain the following code, and identify the output. Is this code running as expected?

```js
function badMath(num) {
  if (num = 42) {
    console.log('It\'s 42');
  } else {
    console.log('It\'s not 42');
  }
}

badMath(42);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What happens if we pass a different number into `badMath`?
2. If this code runs without error, what does that mean about `num = 42`?

**Output:** `It's 42`

**Explanation:**
This code has a bug! Instead of using the comparison operator `==` or `===`, it uses the assignment operator `=` in the conditional. This means that `num` is being assigned the value `42`, and then that assignment expression (which evaluates to `42`) is used as the condition.

Since `42` is truthy, the `if` branch always executes, regardless of what argument was passed in.

The code should use `===`:
```js
if (num === 42) {
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. The same thing happens - it will always output `It's 42` because `num = 42` always evaluates to `42` (which is truthy), no matter what was passed in initially.

2. It means that `num = 42` is an expression (assignment expressions evaluate to the assigned value). Since it's an expression that evaluates to a value (`42`), it can be used in a conditional, even though it's not what we intended.
