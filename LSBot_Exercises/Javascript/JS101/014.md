## Problem 14: Understanding Conditionals

What will be output by this code and why?

```js
let value1 = (3 < 2);
let value2 = (6 % 2 == 0);
let value3 = ('JavaScript' == 'Javascript');
  
if (value1) {
  console.log("It must be value1");
} else if (value2 && value3) {
  console.log("It must be value2 and value3");
}
```

### Bonus Questions
1. Do `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` reference expressions?
2. Would it ever be possible for both of these `console.log` statements to be executed?
3. Are there any return values in this code? If so, what are they?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Nothing will be output because `value1` and `value3` are both falsy.

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Yes since every value is an expression. However, they don't refer to the operations we see, but rather their evaluated value.
2. No. Only one branch in an `if`/`else if`/`else` chain can be executed per run.
3. The `console.log`s return `undefined`. We can also say that each expression has a return value, e.g. `(3 < 2)` returns `false`.
