## Problem 103: Variables as Pointers and Mutability

What will be output by the last two lines? What concept is this code snippet demonstrating?

```js
let defaultNumbers = [8, 3, 1];
let person1 = { numbers: defaultNumbers };
let person2 = person1;

defaultNumbers.pop();

console.log(person1.numbers);
console.log(person2.numbers);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. How many objects exist in this code snippet? How many arrays?
2. What if we remove `defaultNumbers.pop()` and replace it with `person2.numbers.pop()`?
3. What if we change line 2 to `let person1 = { numbers: defaultNumbers.slice() };`?

**Output:**
```
[8, 3]
[8, 3]
```

**Concept:** The snippet demonstrates (1) **variables as pointers**, and (2) **mutability**.

**Explanation:**

All three variables `defaultNumbers`, `person1.numbers`, and `person2.numbers` reference the same array in memory. Additionally, `person1` and `person2` reference the same object. When we mutate the array using `pop()`, the change is visible through all references to that array. Both console.log statements output the same mutated array `[8, 3]` because they're accessing the same array object through different variable paths.

**Bonus Questions:**

1. 1 plain object (excluding arrays) and 1 array. The object is `{ numbers: [8, 3, 1] }` and the array is `[8, 3, 1]`.

2. It's the same thing. Whether we access the array through `defaultNumbers`, `person1.numbers`, or `person2.numbers`, we're mutating the same array, so all references see the change.

```js
person2.numbers.pop();
console.log(person1.numbers);  // [8, 3]
console.log(person2.numbers);  // [8, 3]
console.log(defaultNumbers);   // [8, 3]
```

3. Now `defaultNumbers` will not have been affected because `slice()` creates a new array:

```js
let person1 = { numbers: defaultNumbers.slice() };  // New array
let person2 = person1;

defaultNumbers.pop();

console.log(person1.numbers);  // [8, 3, 1] (unchanged)
console.log(person2.numbers);  // [8, 3, 1] (unchanged)
console.log(defaultNumbers);   // [8, 3] (mutated)
```
