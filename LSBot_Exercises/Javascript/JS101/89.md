## Problem 89: Pass-by-Reference vs Pass-by-Value

Does JS use Pass-by-Reference, Pass-by-Value, both, or something else?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

JavaScript uses a blend of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference that we sometimes call *pass-by-value-of-the-reference* or *call-by-sharing*. As a mental model, we can think of JS as exhibiting pass-by-reference (PBR) behaviour with objects and pass-by-value (PBV) behaviour with immutable data types.

**With primitives (pass-by-value behavior):**

```js
function modify(num) {
  num = 100;
}

let number = 5;
modify(number);
console.log(number);  // 5 (unchanged)
```

The function receives a copy of the value, so changes don't affect the original.

**With objects (pass-by-reference behavior):**

```js
function modify(arr) {
  arr.push(4);
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
modify(numbers);
console.log(numbers);  // [1, 2, 3, 4] (mutated)
```

The function receives a reference to the object, so mutations affect the original.

**But reassignment doesn't affect the original:**

```js
function modify(arr) {
  arr = [5, 6, 7];  // Reassignment
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
modify(numbers);
console.log(numbers);  // [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)
```
