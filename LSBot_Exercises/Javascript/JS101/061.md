## Problem 61: Local Variables

What is a local variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A variable declared within a function or block.

Local variables are only accessible within the scope where they're defined. They're created when the function or block executes and are typically destroyed when execution leaves that scope.

**Examples:**

```js
function myFunction() {
  let localVar = 'I am local';  // local to myFunction
  console.log(localVar);        // accessible here
}

myFunction();
console.log(localVar);  // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined

if (true) {
  let blockVar = 'I am local to this block';  // local to this block
  console.log(blockVar);  // accessible here
}

console.log(blockVar);  // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
```

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they're local to the nearest enclosing block.
