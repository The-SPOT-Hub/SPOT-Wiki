## Problem 44: Function Return Values and Truthiness

What is the output when we run this code? Walk through what happens.

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

let greeting = sayHi();
let word = '';

if (greeting === false) {
  word = 'Something';
} else if (greeting) {
  word = 'Something else';
} else {
  word = greeting;
}

if (word) console.log('Wow');
```

### Bonus Questions
1. Do we invoke `sayHi` every time we reference `greeting`? Why or why not?
2. What if instead we `return` our call to `console.log` within `sayHi`?
3. Is the `sayHi` function truthy? Why or why not?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Output:**
```
Hello!
```

**Walkthrough:**
1. `sayHi()` is invoked, which logs `'Hello!'` to the console
2. `sayHi()` doesn't have an explicit return statement, so it returns `undefined`
3. `greeting` is assigned the value `undefined`
4. First condition: `undefined === false` is `false`, so this branch doesn't execute
5. Second condition: `undefined` is falsy, so this branch doesn't execute
6. The `else` branch executes: `word = greeting` (so `word` is now `undefined`)
7. Final `if`: `undefined` is falsy, so `console.log('Wow')` doesn't execute
8. Total output is just `'Hello!'` from the original function call

**Bonus Questions:**

1. No. We only invoke `sayHi` once on line 5. After that, `greeting` holds the value returned by that invocation (`undefined`). Referencing `greeting` just accesses that value; it doesn't re-invoke the function.

2. If we `return console.log('Hello!')` in `sayHi`, the behavior would be the same. `console.log()` itself returns `undefined`, so returning the result of `console.log()` would still return `undefined`.

3. Yes, the `sayHi` function itself (without calling it) is truthy. Functions are objects, and all objects are truthy:
   ```js
   if (sayHi) {  // truthy
     console.log('Functions are truthy!');
   }
   ```
   But the return value of calling `sayHi()` is `undefined`, which is falsy.
