## Problem 26: Reassignment as Mutation

Is reassignment ever mutating?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes. Index or key reassignment is mutating.

While reassigning a variable itself is not mutation (it just makes the variable reference a different value), reassigning an element within an object or array **is** mutation because it changes the internal state of that object:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[0] = 100;         // This is mutation (index reassignment)
console.log(arr);     // [100, 2, 3]

let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
obj.a = 100;          // This is mutation (property reassignment)
console.log(obj);     // { a: 100, b: 2 }
```

In both cases, we're changing the contents of the array/object, which is mutation. The array/object itself remains the same object in memory, but its internal state has changed.

Compare this to variable reassignment:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr = [100, 2, 3];    // This is NOT mutation (variable reassignment)
```

Here, `arr` now references a completely different array; the original array is unchanged.
