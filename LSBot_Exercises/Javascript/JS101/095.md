## Problem 95: Squaring a Number

Given this expected behavior shown in this snippet, is it possible to write a `squareIt` function that fulfills these requirements? Why or why not?

```js
let myNumber = 2;

squareIt(myNumber);
squareIt(myNumber);
squareIt(myNumber);

console.log(myNumber); // => 256
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What are two different alternatives you could propose to give similar behavior?
2. Write the functions to go along with each of these proposed solutions and show the updated invocations to explain how you would need to use them.

It is possible but we technically won't comply with the requirement of receiving an argument since we'll be disregarding it.

**Explanation:**

Since numbers are primitive values passed by value, we can't modify `myNumber` directly through the parameter. However, we can access the outer `myNumber` variable directly:

```js
function squareIt(num) {
  myNumber = myNumber ** 2;  // Ignores parameter, modifies global
}

let myNumber = 2;
squareIt(myNumber);  // myNumber becomes 4
squareIt(myNumber);  // myNumber becomes 16
squareIt(myNumber);  // myNumber becomes 256
console.log(myNumber); // 256
```

This works but has serious problems:
- The function is tightly coupled to a specific global variable
- The parameter is misleading (it's ignored)
- The function isn't reusable
- It has hidden side effects

**Bonus Questions:**

1. Two different alternatives:

**Alternative 1: Return and reassign**
```js
function squareIt(num) {
  return num ** 2;
}

let myNumber = 2;
myNumber = squareIt(myNumber);  // 4
myNumber = squareIt(myNumber);  // 16
myNumber = squareIt(myNumber);  // 256
console.log(myNumber); // 256
```

**Alternative 2: Use an object wrapper**
```js
function squareIt(obj) {
  obj.value = obj.value ** 2;
}

let myNumber = { value: 2 };
squareIt(myNumber);  // value becomes 4
squareIt(myNumber);  // value becomes 16
squareIt(myNumber);  // value becomes 256
console.log(myNumber.value); // 256
```

2. Full implementations shown above. The first alternative (return and reassign) is the most idiomatic JavaScript approach. It's explicit about what's happening (reassignment) and the function is pure and reusable. The second alternative works but is overly complex for this use case.
