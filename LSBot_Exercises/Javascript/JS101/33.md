## Problem 33: Truthy vs True

Is `truthy` a value? Is `true` a value?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, `truthy` is not a value - it's a classification or category that describes how certain values behave in boolean contexts. 

Yes, `true` is a value - specifically, it's one of the boolean primitive values in JavaScript.

Any value that coerces to `true` in a boolean context is called "truthy", but that doesn't make `truthy` itself a value. For example, the number `1` is a truthy value, the string `"hello"` is a truthy value, and `true` itself is also truthy (and is literally the boolean value `true`).
