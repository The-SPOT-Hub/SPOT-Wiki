## Problem 8: Initialize

What does it mean to **initialize**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

To **initialize** a variable means to assign it an initial value at the time of declaration. For example, in `let count = 0;`, the variable `count` is initialized with the value `0`. Initialization is optional in JavaScript - you can declare a variable without initializing it (e.g., `let count;`), in which case it will have the value `undefined` until you assign it a value.
