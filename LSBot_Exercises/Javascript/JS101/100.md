## Problem 100: Demonstrating a Concept

What does it mean for a code snippet to be 'demonstrating' a concept?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A code snippet "demonstrates" a concept when it shows how that concept works in practice through executable code. The snippet should clearly illustrate the concept's behavior, making it possible to understand the concept by examining the code and its output.

**Key characteristics of a snippet that demonstrates a concept:**

1. **Shows the concept in action** - The code exhibits the behavior associated with the concept
2. **Produces observable results** - You can see the concept's effects through output or program behavior
3. **Is minimal and focused** - Doesn't include unnecessary complexity that obscures the concept
4. **Can be explained using the concept** - The concept is the best or primary explanation for what's happening

**Example - Demonstrating variable shadowing:**

```js
let name = 'Outer';

function test() {
  let name = 'Inner';  // Shadows outer variable
  console.log(name);   // 'Inner'
}

test();
console.log(name);  // 'Outer'
```

This demonstrates shadowing because:
- It shows a local variable hiding an outer one
- The output reveals the shadowing behavior
- Shadowing is the primary concept needed to explain why we see 'Inner' then 'Outer'

**What it doesn't mean:**

A snippet doesn't demonstrate a concept just because that concept exists somewhere in the code. For example:

```js
let x = 5;
console.log(x);
```

This uses variables, but it doesn't really "demonstrate" anything about variables because there's nothing interesting or educational happening. It's just basic usage without showcasing any particular concept or behavior.
