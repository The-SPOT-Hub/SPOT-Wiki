## Problem 23: Mutating Variables

Do we **mutate** variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, we don't mutate variables. We mutate **values** (specifically, objects). Variables are just names that reference values. We can reassign variables to reference different values, but that's not mutation.

Mutation means changing the internal state of an object. Only objects (arrays, plain objects, etc.) can be mutated:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);  // Mutating the array object
```

We don't mutate the variable `arr` - we mutate the array that `arr` references. The variable itself still references the same array object; the array's contents have changed.

Reassignment, on the other hand, makes a variable reference a different value:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr = [4, 5, 6];  // Reassignment, not mutation
```
