## Problem 27: Variables in Arrays

Predict and explain the output of this snippet.

```js
let num1 = 1;
let arr1 = [num1, 2, 3];

num1 = 42;

console.log(arr1); // What is output by this line?

arr1[0] = 42;

console.log(arr1); // What is output by this line?
```

### Bonus Questions
1. Does `arr1` contain the variable `num1` as an element?
2. Is there anything we can do to `num1` to change the value at index 0 in our array after line 2?
3. What could we do instead of line 7 (`arr1[0] = 42`) that would have the same outcome on line 9?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

```js
console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(arr1); // [42, 2, 3]
```

**Explanation:**
On line 2, when the array is created, it stores the value that `num1` references (which is `1`), not the variable itself. So when `num1` is reassigned to `42` on line 4, the array is unaffected.

Line 7 performs index reassignment, which mutates the array by changing the value at index 0 to `42`.

**Bonus Questions:**
1. No, `arr1` contains the value `1`, not the variable `num1`.
2. No. Once the array is created with the value `1`, there's no way to change that element by modifying `num1` because the array doesn't reference the variable.
3. 
```js
arr1 = [42, 2, 3];
// or
arr1.shift();
arr1.unshift(42);
```
