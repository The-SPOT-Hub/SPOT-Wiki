## Problem 37: What is an Expression?

What does it mean for something to be an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

An expression is anything that JavaScript can evaluate to a value, even if that value is `undefined` or `null`. With few exceptions, almost everything you write in JavaScript is an expression.

Examples of expressions:
```js
42                    // literal value
2 + 2                 // arithmetic operation
"hello"               // string literal
myVariable            // variable reference
myFunction()          // function call
x > 5                 // comparison
true && false         // logical operation
```

All of these can be evaluated to produce a value, so they're expressions. The key characteristic of an expression is that it can be used anywhere JavaScript expects a value.
