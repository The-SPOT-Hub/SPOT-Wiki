## Problem 52: When Short-Circuiting Occurs

Does short-circuiting occur when a truthy or a falsy value is encountered?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

It depends. `||` short-circuits on a truthy value, but `&&` short-circuits on a falsy value.

**`||` (OR) - short-circuits on truthy:**
```js
let result = 'hello' || console.log('This never runs');
// Returns 'hello' immediately because it's truthy
```

The `||` operator wants to find a truthy value. Once it finds one, it stops (short-circuits) and returns that value.

**`&&` (AND) - short-circuits on falsy:**
```js
let result = false && console.log('This never runs');
// Returns false immediately because it's falsy
```

The `&&` operator wants to ensure all values are truthy. Once it finds a falsy value, it stops (short-circuits) and returns that value.

**Summary:**
- `||`: "Give me the first truthy thing" → short-circuits on truthy
- `&&`: "Stop at the first falsy thing" → short-circuits on falsy
