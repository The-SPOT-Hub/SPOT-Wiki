## Problem 17: Character Value Function

Write a function that accepts an alphabetical character and returns the 'value' of that character.

The 'value' is relative to where the letter appears in the alphabet: 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, 'c' is 3, etc.

For invalid inputs, return `null`.

### Bonus Questions
1. What assumptions did you have to make in order to write this function?
2. Does your function account for uppercase letters? If not, how could you modify it to do so?

<summary>Hints:</summary>

Consider using the `charCodeAt()` method to get the character code, then calculate the position based on the code for 'a' or 'A'.

```js
function charValue(char) {
  if (typeof char !== 'string' || char.length !== 1) {
    return null;
  }
  
  let code = char.toLowerCase().charCodeAt(0);
  let aCode = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
  
  if (code < aCode || code > 'z'.charCodeAt(0)) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return code - aCode + 1;
}
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Assumptions include: handling only single characters, treating lowercase and uppercase the same, returning `null` for non-alphabetic characters.
2. The solution above handles uppercase by converting to lowercase first using `toLowerCase()`.
