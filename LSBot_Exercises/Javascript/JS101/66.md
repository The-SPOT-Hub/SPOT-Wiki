## Problem 66: What is a Block?

What is a block?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Blocks are segments of one or more statements and expressions enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Each pair of braces in constructs like `if`/`else` and the `for` and `while` loops define new block scopes.

**Examples:**

```js
// if statement block
if (condition) {
  // This is a block
  let x = 5;
}

// for loop block
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // This is a block
  console.log(i);
}

// Bare block (standalone)
{
  // This is also a block
  let blockScoped = 'only accessible here';
}

// Function body (also a block)
function myFunc() {
  // This is a block
  let localVar = 'local';
}
```

**Block scope:**

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they're only accessible within the block where they're declared:

```js
if (true) {
  let blockVar = 'I am block-scoped';
  console.log(blockVar);  // Accessible here
}

console.log(blockVar);  // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
```
