## Problem 81: Nesting Depth Limit

How many blocks deep can we go before we can't access variables from the outermost scope?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

There is no set limit for that. We should consider readability, though, and avoid deeply nested blocks.

**Technically unlimited:**

```js
let level0 = 'level 0';

{
  let level1 = 'level 1';
  {
    let level2 = 'level 2';
    {
      let level3 = 'level 3';
      {
        let level4 = 'level 4';
        {
          let level5 = 'level 5';
          // Can still access level0!
          console.log(level0);  // Works fine
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can nest as deeply as you want, and JavaScript will still walk up the scope chain to find variables.

**But should you?**

No. Deep nesting makes code hard to read and maintain:

**Hard to read:**
```js
if (condition1) {
  if (condition2) {
    if (condition3) {
      if (condition4) {
        // What are we even checking for anymore?
        doSomething();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Better:**
```js
if (!condition1) return;
if (!condition2) return;
if (!condition3) return;
if (!condition4) return;

doSomething();
```

**Best practices:**
- **Aim for 2-3 levels maximum** for readability
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Extract nested logic into separate functions
- If you find yourself nesting deeply, it's often a sign to refactor
