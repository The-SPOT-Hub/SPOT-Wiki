## Problem 2: Primitive Data Types

What does it mean for a data type to be **primitive**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Primitive values are always immutable; they don't have parts that one can change. Such values are said to be **atomic**; they're indivisible. If a variable contains a primitive value, all you can do to that variable is use it in an expression or reassign it: give it an entirely new value. All operations on primitive values evaluate as new values.
