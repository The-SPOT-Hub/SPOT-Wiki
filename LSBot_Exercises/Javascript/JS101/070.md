## Problem 70: forEach and Variable Scope

We're expecting that on line 12, we'll print out the last sentence we made. Is this what happens? Why or why not?

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let numberEnthusiast = 'Lisa Simpson';
let sentence;

numbers.forEach(num => {
  let sentence = numberEnthusiast + ` loves the number ${num}!`;
  console.log(sentence);
});

console.log(sentence);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What are two distinct ways that we could keep track of the 'last' sentence to print out?
2. What happens if we comment out `let sentence;` on line 3?
3. How many `sentence` variables exist in this code? What scopes are they available in?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Line 12 prints `undefined`.

**Explanation:**

On line 3, `sentence` is declared but not initialized, so it has the value `undefined`. Inside the `forEach` callback (lines 6-8), a NEW local variable `sentence` is declared with `let`. This creates a separate variable that shadows the outer `sentence`. The outer `sentence` is never assigned a value, so when we log it on line 12, it's still `undefined`.

The forEach callback logs:
```
Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
Lisa Simpson loves the number 2!
Lisa Simpson loves the number 3!
```

But the final line logs: `undefined`

**Bonus Questions:**

1. Two ways to keep track of the last sentence:

**Option 1 - Remove the `let` inside forEach:**
```js
let sentence;

numbers.forEach(num => {
  sentence = numberEnthusiast + ` loves the number ${num}!`;  // No 'let'
  console.log(sentence);
});

console.log(sentence);  // Last sentence
```

**Option 2 - Use a different variable name:**
```js
let lastSentence;

numbers.forEach(num => {
  let sentence = numberEnthusiast + ` loves the number ${num}!`;
  console.log(sentence);
  lastSentence = sentence;
});

console.log(lastSentence);  // Last sentence
```

2. If we comment out `let sentence;` on line 3, we get a `ReferenceError: sentence is not defined` on line 12, because the `sentence` inside the forEach is local to that callback and can't be accessed outside.

3. Two `sentence` variables exist:
   - One in the outer scope (line 3) - available from line 3 onwards in the outer scope
   - One in the forEach callback scope (line 6) - only available inside the callback, shadows the outer one
