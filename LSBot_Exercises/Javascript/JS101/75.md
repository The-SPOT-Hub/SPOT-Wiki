## Problem 75: Variable Shadowing

At a high level, what does it mean for a variable to be shadowed?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner variable "shadows" (hides) the outer one, making the outer variable inaccessible within that inner scope.

**Example:**

```js
let name = 'Outer';

function myFunction() {
  let name = 'Inner';  // Shadows the outer 'name'
  console.log(name);   // 'Inner' - can't access outer 'name'
}

myFunction();
console.log(name);  // 'Outer' - outer scope unchanged
```

The inner `name` takes precedence in the function scope, effectively hiding the outer `name` from within that scope. The outer `name` is still there and unaffected; it's just not accessible from inside the function.

**Key points:**
- The shadowed (outer) variable still exists, it's just inaccessible in the inner scope
- The shadowing (inner) variable is completely separate from the outer one
- Changes to the inner variable don't affect the outer variable
