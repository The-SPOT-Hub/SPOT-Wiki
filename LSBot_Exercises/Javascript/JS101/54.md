## Problem 54: Logical Operators as Flow Control

Are `&&` and `||` operators or flow control?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

They are **both**. `&&` and `||` are operators, but they also provide a form of flow control through short-circuiting.

**As operators:**
They perform logical operations and return values:
```js
let result = 5 || 10;           // result is 5
let value = true && 'hello';    // value is 'hello'
```

**As flow control:**
Through short-circuiting, they can control whether certain code executes:
```js
// Instead of: if (isLoggedIn) { showDashboard(); }
isLoggedIn && showDashboard();

// Instead of: if (!user) { user = 'Guest'; }
user = user || 'Guest';

// Prevent errors
user && user.profile && user.profile.displayName
```

In the examples above, whether the right-hand side executes depends on the left-hand side value, making it a form of flow control.

**This dual nature makes them powerful but potentially confusing:**
```js
// As operators (clear)
let name = inputName || 'Default';

// As flow control (can be less clear than if statement)
count > 0 && processItems();

// Sometimes an if statement is clearer:
if (count > 0) {
  processItems();
}
```

Use judgment about when short-circuit evaluation improves or hinders code readability.
