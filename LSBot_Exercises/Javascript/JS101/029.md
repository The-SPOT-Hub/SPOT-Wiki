## Problem 29: Function Parameters and Mutation

What does line 10 output and why? Explain what happens within `aFunction` to explain this.

```js
function aFunction(arr) {
  arr = ['hello'];
  arr.push('world');
}

let arr = ['hello'];
aFunction(arr);
console.log(arr);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What is the caller, argument, and return value of `push` in this code? How does the caller relate to `arr` on line 8?
2. How many `arr` variables exist in this snippet?
3. How many arrays exist after this code has run?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```js
console.log(arr);  // ['hello']
```

**Explanation:**
When `aFunction` is called, the parameter `arr` initially references the same array as the outer `arr` variable. However, on line 2, the parameter `arr` is reassigned to reference a new array `['hello']`. This reassignment only affects the local parameter variable, not the outer `arr`. The `push` on line 3 mutates this new array (which only the parameter references), but has no effect on the original array. The outer `arr` remains unchanged because the function's parameter was reassigned before any mutation occurred.

**Bonus Questions:**
1. The caller is the local `arr` parameter (which references `['hello']` after reassignment). The argument is `'world'`. The return value is `2` (the new length of the array). The caller is a different array than the outer `arr` on line 6 because of the reassignment on line 2.

2. Two `arr` variables exist: one in the outer scope and one as the function parameter (local scope).

3. Three arrays exist after execution:
   - The original `['hello']` (referenced by outer `arr`)
   - The `['hello']` created on line 2 (no longer referenced after function execution)
   - The final state of that array: `['hello', 'world']` (also no longer referenced)
