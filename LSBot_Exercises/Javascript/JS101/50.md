## Problem 50: Using Parentheses for Clarity

Assuming that parentheses aren't required, should we *use* parenthesis to add clarity, or *omit* parenthesis to avoid clutter?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

This is a matter of style and team preference, but generally: **use parentheses when they improve clarity**, even if they're not strictly required.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Use parentheses** when the precedence might not be immediately obvious to readers:
```js
// Less clear
if (age >= 18 && isMember || completedSurvey) { ... }

// More clear
if ((age >= 18 && isMember) || completedSurvey) { ... }
```

2. **Use parentheses** in complex expressions with multiple operators:
```js
// Less clear
let result = a + b * c - d / e;

// More clear (if this is the intended order)
let result = a + (b * c) - (d / e);
```

3. **Omit parentheses** for very simple, well-known precedence:
```js
// Unnecessary parentheses (everyone knows multiplication comes first)
let area = (length) * (width);

// Better
let area = length * width;
```

**The key principle:** If there's any doubt about how an expression will be read, use parentheses. Code is read more often than it's written, so favor clarity over brevity.
