## Problem 92: Methods and Pass-by-Reference

Are the methods of mutable data types always pass-by-reference?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No. For example, the `concat` and `indexOf` array methods don't receive objects as arguments.

Whether a method exhibits pass-by-reference behavior depends on what arguments it receives, not on what object it's called on.

**Methods that receive objects (PBR behavior possible):**

```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

arr1.push(...arr2);  // Modifies arr1, but arr2 is spread into primitives
console.log(arr1);   // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Methods that receive primitives (PBV behavior):**

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

// indexOf receives a primitive number
let index = arr.indexOf(2);  // 1

// concat can receive arrays, but returns a new array (non-mutating)
let arr2 = [4, 5];
let result = arr.concat(arr2);
console.log(arr);     // [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)
console.log(result);  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (new array)
```

Even mutating methods like `push`, `splice`, etc., receive their arguments according to the same rules: primitives by value, objects by reference. The fact that the method mutates the calling object doesn't change how its arguments are passed.
