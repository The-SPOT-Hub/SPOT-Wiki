## Problem 24: Array Mutability with Primitives

Is an array that contains *only* primitive elements still mutable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, an array is always mutable, regardless of what elements it contains. The fact that the elements are primitive values doesn't change the array's mutability:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];  // array of primitive numbers

arr.push(4);          // mutating the array
console.log(arr);     // [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr[0] = 100;         // mutating the array
console.log(arr);     // [100, 2, 3, 4]
```

The primitive values themselves cannot be mutated (numbers, strings, booleans, etc. are immutable), but the array structure that contains them can be modified by adding, removing, or replacing elements.
