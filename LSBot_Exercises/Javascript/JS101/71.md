## Problem 71: Block Scope with if/else

Explain what happens when we run this code and the output we will get.

```js
let greeting = 'Hello';

if (greeting) {
  greeting = 'Howdy';
  let farewell = 'Goodbye';
  console.log(greeting);
  console.log(farewell);
} else {
  greeting = 'Hi';
  let farewell = 'Adios';
  console.log(greeting);
  console.log(farewell);
}

console.log(greeting);
console.log(farewell);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. How many `greeting` variables exist in this code? How many `farewell`?
2. What's the difference between the action happening on lines 4 & 5?
3. What happens if we remove the `let` declaration on line 5?

**Output:**
```
Howdy
Goodbye
Howdy
ReferenceError: farewell is not defined
```

**Explanation:**

1. Line 1: `greeting` is declared and initialized to `'Hello'`
2. Line 3: `greeting` is truthy, so the `if` block executes
3. Line 4: `greeting` is reassigned to `'Howdy'` (same outer variable)
4. Line 5: `farewell` is declared locally within the `if` block
5. Line 6: Logs `'Howdy'`
6. Line 7: Logs `'Goodbye'`
7. Line 8-12: The `else` block doesn't execute
8. Line 14: Logs `'Howdy'` (the reassigned outer `greeting`)
9. Line 15: Throws `ReferenceError` because `farewell` is block-scoped to the `if` block and not accessible here

**Bonus Questions:**

1. One `greeting` variable exists (declared on line 1, reassigned on lines 4 and 9). Two `farewell` variables exist - one in the `if` block (line 5) and one in the `else` block (line 10). When discussing this, explain that the `farewell` variable inside the `else` block is never initialized because the `else` branch doesn't execute.

2. Line 4 is reassignment (no `let`, modifies existing outer variable). Line 5 is declaration (with `let`, creates new block-scoped variable).

3. If we remove `let` on line 5:
```js
farewell = 'Goodbye';  // Without let
```
This would create/assign to a variable in the outer scope (or create a global if none exists). Then line 15 would successfully log `'Goodbye'` instead of throwing an error. However, this would create an implicit global in strict mode, which throws an error. In non-strict mode, it creates a global variable.
