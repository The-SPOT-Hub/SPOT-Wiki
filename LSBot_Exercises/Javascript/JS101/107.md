## Problem 107: Variables and Arrays

What will be output by lines 7 and 11? What concept is this demonstrating?

```js
let num1 = 1;
let arr1 = [num1, 2, 3];

num1 = 42;

console.log(arr1);

arr1[0] = 42;

console.log(arr1);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. We've learned that reassignment is non-mutating. If that's the case, how can we explain what happens on line 9?
2. Does `arr1` contain the variable `num1`?
3. What could we do to `num1` to change the first element of `arr1`?

**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3]
[42, 2, 3]
```

**Concept:** This demonstrates **variables as pointers** (and the distinction between variables and values).

**Explanation:**

**Line 7:**
- When `arr1` is created on line 2, it stores the *value* that `num1` references (`1`), not the variable itself
- Reassigning `num1` on line 4 doesn't affect the array
- Output: `[1, 2, 3]`

**Line 11:**
- Line 9 uses index assignment to change the first element
- This is mutation of the array
- Output: `[42, 2, 3]`

The key insight: arrays contain values, not variables. When we write `[num1, 2, 3]`, JavaScript evaluates `num1` to get its value (`1`) and stores that value in the array.

**Bonus Questions:**

1. While reassignment is non-mutating to the variable being reassigned, **index assignment** (`arr1[0] = 42`) is actually a form of mutation. It changes the contents of the array object without creating a new array. So:
   - `arr1 = [...]` would be reassignment (non-mutating to the original array)
   - `arr1[0] = 42` is mutation (changes the array object itself)

2. No. `arr1` contains the *value* `1`, not the variable `num1`. Arrays (and objects in general) can only contain values, not variables.

3. Nothing. Once the array is created with the value `1`, there's no way to change that element by modifying `num1`. The array has no connection to the variable `num1` - it only received its value at creation time.

The only way to change the first element is to mutate the array directly:
```js
arr1[0] = num1;  // Use num1's current value
```

But this is still using the value of `num1`, not creating a link to the variable.
