## Problem 105: Variable Shadowing in Loops

What is output by lines 10 and 11 and why? What concept does this demonstrate?

```js
let a = 'Bob';
let b = 'Kate';

for (let a = 0; a < 1; a += 1) {
  a = 'Bill';
  b = 'Sarah';
}

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What does the variable `a` within the `for` loop reference?
2. What changes if we remove `let` from line 4? Why?
3. How could we fix this code? Provide 2 distinct solutions.

**Output:**
```
Bob
Sarah
```

**Concept:** This demonstrates **variable shadowing**.

**Explanation:**

The `for` loop's initialization `let a = 0` creates a new block-scoped variable `a` that shadows the outer `a` variable. Inside the loop:
- The loop's `a` is initialized to `0`
- It's reassigned to `'Bill'`
- The outer `a` ('Bob') is never touched because it's shadowed
- `b` has no shadow, so the outer `b` is reassigned to `'Sarah'`

After the loop, the outer `a` is still `'Bob'` and `b` is now `'Sarah'`.

**Bonus Questions:**

1. The variable `a` within the loop is initialized to `0`, then reassigned to `'Bill'` in the loop body. It's a separate variable from the outer `a`.

2. If we remove `let` from line 4:
```js
for (a = 0; a < 1; a += 1) {  // No 'let'
  a = 'Bill';
  b = 'Sarah';
}
```

Now there's no shadowing - the outer `a` is being used:
- `a` is reassigned to `0`
- Loop condition: `0 < 1` is true, loop body executes
- `a` is reassigned to `'Bill'`
- `b` is reassigned to `'Sarah'`
- Loop increment: `a += 1` tries to do `'Bill' + 1`, which results in `'Bill1'` (string concatenation)
- Loop condition: `'Bill1' < 1` is false, loop exits

Output would be:
```
Bill1
Sarah
```

3. Two ways to fix this code:

**Option 1: Rename the loop variable**
```js
let a = 'Bob';
let b = 'Kate';

for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 1) {  // Use 'i' instead of 'a'
  a = 'Bill';
  b = 'Sarah';
}

console.log(a);  // 'Bill'
console.log(b);  // 'Sarah'
```

**Option 2: Remove the loop variable declaration**
```js
let a = 'Bob';
let b = 'Kate';

for (a = 0; a < 1; a += 1) {  // Use existing 'a', be careful with increment
  a = 'Bill';
  b = 'Sarah';
  break;  // Break immediately to avoid string concatenation issues
}

console.log(a);  // 'Bill'
console.log(b);  // 'Sarah'
```
