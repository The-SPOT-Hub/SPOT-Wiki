## Problem 104: Truthiness and Return Values

What happens when we run this code? What is output? What concept is being demonstrated?

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
  
let greeting = sayHi();
let word = '';
  
if (greeting) {
  word = 'Something';
} else if (greeting === false) {
  word = 'Something else';
} else {
  word = greeting;
}

if (word) console.log(greeting);
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What precisely does `greeting` reference? What does `word` reference?
2. How does this problem change if we remove the parenthesis from line 5? How do we explain this change?
3. How does this problem change if instead of the body of `sayHi` being `console.log('Hello!');` it was `return 'Hello!';`?

**Output:**
```
Hello!
```

(Nothing else is printed)

**Concept:** This demonstrates **truthiness** (and implicitly, return values).

**Explanation:**

When `sayHi()` is called, it logs `'Hello!'` but returns `undefined` since there's no explicit return statement. The variable `greeting` is then assigned this `undefined` value. In the first `if` condition, `undefined` is falsy, so that branch doesn't execute. The `else if` condition checks if `undefined === false`, which is false, so that branch also doesn't execute. This means we fall through to the `else` block, which assigns `word = greeting`, making `word` also `undefined`. In the final `if` statement, since `word` is falsy, the `console.log(greeting)` doesn't execute. The total output is just `'Hello!'` from the original function call.

**Bonus Questions:**

1. `greeting` references `undefined` (the return value of `sayHi()`). `word` also references `undefined` at the end (assigned in the else block).

2. If we remove the parenthesis from line 5:
```js
let greeting = sayHi;  // No parentheses
```

Now `greeting` references the function itself, not its return value. Functions are truthy, so:
- The first `if (greeting)` is true
- `word = 'Something'`
- The final `if (word)` is true (non-empty string)
- We'd see: `Hello!` followed by the function definition being logged

This change demonstrates the concept of **first-class functions** - functions can be assigned to variables and are values themselves.

3. If `sayHi` returned `'Hello!'`:
```js
function sayHi() {
  return 'Hello!';
}
```

Then:
- `greeting` would be `'Hello!'` (a truthy string)
- First `if` would execute, `word = 'Something'`
- Final `if (word)` would be true
- Output would be: `Hello!` (from console.log on line 17)

Actually, wait - line 17 logs `greeting`, not `word`. So the output would just be `Hello!` regardless. But the path through the code would be different.
