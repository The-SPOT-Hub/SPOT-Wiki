## Problem 6: Promise.all vs Promise.race

Compare and contrast `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`. Describe a practical use case for each.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Promise.all()**

- **Purpose**: Takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise that fulfills when all of the input promises have fulfilled.
- **Fulfillment Value**: An array of the fulfillment values from the input promises, in the same order.
- **Rejection**: Rejects immediately if any of the input promises reject. The rejection reason is the reason of the first promise that rejected.
- **Use Case**: When you need to perform multiple independent asynchronous operations and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding. For example, fetching a user's profile information and their recent posts from two different API endpoints simultaneously to build a dashboard.

**Promise.race()**

- **Purpose**: Takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the input promises fulfills or rejects.
- **Fulfillment/Rejection Value**: The fulfillment or rejection value of the first promise to settle.
- **Use Case**: When you want to get the result from the fastest of several asynchronous operations. A common example is setting a timeout for an API request. You can race a fetch promise against a setTimeout promise that rejects. If the timeout promise settles first, you can cancel or ignore the API request.
