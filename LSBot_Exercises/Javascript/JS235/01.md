## Problem 1: Event Target vs Current Target

Explain the difference between `event.target` and `event.currentTarget` in the context of DOM event handling. Provide a simple HTML and JavaScript example to illustrate when they would be different.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

`event.target` is a reference to the element that originally dispatched the event. It's the innermost element that was clicked or interacted with. `event.currentTarget` is a reference to the element that the event listener is currently attached to.

In the case of event bubbling, these two can be different. If you attach a listener to a parent element (like a `<ul>`), `event.currentTarget` will always be the `<ul>`, while `event.target` will be the specific child element (like an `<li>`) that was clicked.

```html
<ul id="parent-list">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
const list = document.getElementById('parent-list');

list.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('event.target:', event.target.tagName); // -> LI
  console.log('event.currentTarget:', event.currentTarget.tagName); // -> UL
});
```

</details>
