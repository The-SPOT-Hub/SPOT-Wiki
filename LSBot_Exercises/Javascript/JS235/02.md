## Problem 2: Same-Origin Policy and CORS

What is the "Same-Origin Policy"? Explain why it's a necessary security measure and how CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows developers to work around its restrictions.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The Same-Origin Policy is a security mechanism in web browsers that restricts how a document or script loaded from one "origin" can interact with a resource from another "origin". An origin is defined by the combination of scheme (e.g., http), host (e.g., example.com), and port (e.g., 80).

This policy is necessary to prevent malicious scripts on one page from obtaining sensitive data from another web page through DOM manipulation or by reading server responses. For example, it prevents a script on a malicious site from making a fetch request to your online banking site and reading the response.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin access to selected resources from a different origin. A server can use the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header to specify which origins are permitted to access its resources.
