## Problem 10: npm Scripts and Transpilation

Explain what npm scripts are and where they are defined. What is transpilation, and when might you need it in a JS project?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- npm scripts are command aliases defined in the scripts field of package.json; you run them with `npm run <script>` (or npx for binaries).

- Transpilation is converting code from one version/variant of JS to another (e.g., modern ESNext to older ES5) for compatibility with environments that don't support newer features. You might need it for browser support or older Node versions.
