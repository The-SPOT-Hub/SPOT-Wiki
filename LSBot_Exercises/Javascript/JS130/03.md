## Problem 3: this and Strict Mode

In strict mode, what does `this` refer to inside a regular function call (not as a method) and how does that differ from non-strict mode? Given the code, what will log?

```javascript
'use strict';
function show() { console.log(this); }
show();
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- In non-strict mode, `this` in a plain function call defaults to the global object (window in browsers).

- In strict mode, `this` is undefined.

- The code logs undefined.

</details>
