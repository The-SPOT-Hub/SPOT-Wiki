## Problem 1: Hoisting and var vs let

Explain how hoisting works for function declarations, function expressions, and variables declared with var vs let/const. What is the "temporal dead zone"?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- Function declarations are hoisted with their definitions, so you can call them before they appear.

- Function expressions are hoisted as variables; only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function value.

- var variables are hoisted and initialized to undefined at the top of their scope.

- let/const are hoisted but not initialized; accessing them before their declaration throws a ReferenceError. This pre-declaration phase is called the temporal dead zone.
