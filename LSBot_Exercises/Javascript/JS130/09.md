## Problem 9: Testing with Jest

In Jest, when should you use `toBe` vs `toEqual`? Also, briefly describe the SEAT approach to writing tests.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- `toBe` uses strict equality (===); good for primitives and reference identity.

- `toEqual` checks deep structural equivalence; good for objects/arrays with equal content.

- SEAT: Setup (arrange data/system under test), Exercise (invoke behavior), Assert (verify outcomes with expect), Teardown (clean up if needed).
