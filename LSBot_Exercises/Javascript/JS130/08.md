## Problem 8: setTimeout Ordering

What is the output order, and why?

```javascript
console.log('A');
setTimeout(() => console.log('B'), 0);
console.log('C');
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- Output: A, C, B

- setTimeout with 0ms schedules the callback to the task queue; it runs after the current call stack is empty, so synchronous logs happen first.
