# JS110
## Problem 2

Create a function that takes a string as an argument and return an object with letters of the string and their occurrences as properties:

## Examples:

```javascript
countOccurencies('abbab'); => {a:2, b: 3}
```

**Further Exploration:**

Create a function that takes the object that your function returned as an argument and returns a string in with all the letters that appears in the object, in alphabetical order appearing as many times as the value states. Order doesn't matter.

```javascript
{a:1, k:3, g:2} => 'aggkkk'
```
