## Problem 3: Debugging DOM Methods

The following code is supposed to log the text content of a paragraph to the console when it's clicked. However, it throws an error. Identify and fix the bug.

**HTML:**
```html
<p id="info">This is some important information.</p>
```

**JavaScript (with bug):**
```javascript
const paragraph = document.getElementByID('info');

paragraph.addEventListener('click', event => {
  console.log(event.target.textContent);
});
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Problem:** The method `document.getElementByID` is incorrect due to capitalization. The ID should be `Id`.

**Corrected JavaScript:**
```javascript
const paragraph = document.getElementById('info'); // Corrected method name

paragraph.addEventListener('click', event => {
  console.log(event.target.textContent);
});
```

</details>
