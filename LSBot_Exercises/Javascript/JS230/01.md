## Problem 1: Event Target vs Current Target

What is the difference between `event.target` and `event.currentTarget`? Provide a scenario where they would refer to different elements.

`event.target` refers to the element that the event originated from (e.g., the specific element that was clicked). `event.currentTarget` refers to the element that the event listener is attached to.

They would be different when using event delegation. For example, if you have a click event listener on a `<ul>` element, and a user clicks on one of its `<li>` children, `event.target` would be the `<li>` element, while `event.currentTarget` would be the `<ul>` element.
