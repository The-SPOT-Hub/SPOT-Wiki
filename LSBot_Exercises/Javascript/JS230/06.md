## Problem 6: Children vs ChildNodes

Explain the difference between `element.children` and `element.childNodes`. Which one is generally safer to use for iterating over child elements, and why?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

`element.childNodes` returns a NodeList containing all child nodes, which includes element nodes, text nodes (like whitespace between tags), and comment nodes. `element.children` returns an HTMLCollection containing only the child element nodes.

`element.children` is generally safer and more predictable for iterating over child elements because it filters out non-element nodes like whitespace, which can often cause unexpected behavior.
