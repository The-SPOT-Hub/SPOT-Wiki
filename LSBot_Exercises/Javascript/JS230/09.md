## Problem 9: DOMContentLoaded Event

Why is it common practice to wrap DOM manipulation code inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

It's common practice to wait for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure that the entire HTML document has been loaded and parsed by the browser before any JavaScript code attempts to access or manipulate its elements. If a script runs before the DOM is ready, it might try to select an element that doesn't exist yet, which would result in an error or unexpected behavior.
