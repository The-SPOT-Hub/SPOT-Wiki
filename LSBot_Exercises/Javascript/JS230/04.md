## Problem 4: Event Delegation

What is event delegation and what is its primary advantage?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to handle events that occur on its descendant elements. The event bubbles up from the target element to the parent, where the listener can handle it.

The primary advantage is that it simplifies code and improves resource usage, especially for lists or tables with many interactive elements. You only need one event listener for the parent instead of attaching separate listeners to every child. It also automatically handles events for child elements that are added to the DOM dynamically after the page has loaded.
