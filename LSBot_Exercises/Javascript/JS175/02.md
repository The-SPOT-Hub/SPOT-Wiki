## Problem 2: Express Middleware

Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js. What is its role in the request-response cycle, and what are common use cases for it?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Middleware functions in Express are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and a `next` function to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

- **Role**: Their primary role is to perform tasks between the time the server receives a request and sends a response. They can modify `req` and `res` objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware.

- **Common Use Cases**: Logging request details, parsing the body of incoming requests (e.g., `express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`), serving static files (`express.static`), handling user authentication, and managing sessions.
