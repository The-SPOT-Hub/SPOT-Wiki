- **Static content** refers to files that are delivered to the user exactly as they are stored on the server. The content does not change based on user interaction or other parameters. Examples include CSS stylesheets, client-side JavaScript files, and images.

- **Dynamic content** is generated on the server at the time of the request. Its content can be customized based on user input, data from a database, or other variables. Examples include a personalized user dashboard, a page displaying search results, or the contents of a shopping cart.
