## Problem 6: Form Submission Handling

An HTML form submits data via a `POST` request to `/lists/new`. The form contains a text input with `name="listTitle"`. Write the Express route handler for this request. It should extract the `listTitle` from the request body, use `req.flash()` to set a success message, and then redirect the user to the `/lists` page. (Assume `express.urlencoded`, `express-session`, and `express-flash` middleware are already configured).

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```javascript
app.post('/lists/new', (req, res) => {
  const listTitle = req.body.listTitle;
  // In a real application, you would persist this data.
  req.flash('success', `The list "${listTitle}" has been created.`);
  res.redirect('/lists');
});
```
