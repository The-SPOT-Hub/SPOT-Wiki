## Problem 5: Pug Template with Iteration

You are passing an array of objects called `todoLists` to a Pug template. Each object has a `title` property and a `todos` property (which is an array). Write a Pug template that renders a page title "Todo Lists" in an `h1` tag, and then iterates through `todoLists` to display the title of each list in an `<h2>` tag.

```pug
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    title Todo Lists
  body
    h1 Todo Lists
    each list in todoLists
      h2= list.title
```

</details>
