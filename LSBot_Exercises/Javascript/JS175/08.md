## Problem 8: Static Assets Not Loading

A developer is building an Express application. They have created a `public` directory at the root of their project, with a `stylesheets` subdirectory inside it containing `app.css`. In their Pug layout, they try to load the stylesheet with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/app.css">`. However, the browser returns a 404 error for the CSS file. What is the most likely missing line of code in their main application file (`app.js`)?

The developer most likely forgot to configure the `express.static` middleware. This middleware is required to serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. The missing line is:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

This tells Express to treat the `public` directory as a root for serving static assets.
