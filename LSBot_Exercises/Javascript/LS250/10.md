## Problem 10: Binary Tree Types

Describe the different types of binary trees and their structural properties.

**Tree Types to Consider:**
- Full Binary Tree
- Complete Binary Tree
- Perfect Binary Tree
- Balanced Binary Tree

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

## 1. Full Binary Tree

**Definition:** Every node has either 0 or 2 children (no nodes with only one child).

**Characteristics:**
- All internal nodes have exactly two children
- Leaf nodes have no children
- Can be unbalanced

## 2. Complete Binary Tree

**Definition:** All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

**Characteristics:**
- Efficiently stored in arrays
- Used in heap data structures
- Maintains a compact structure

## 3. Perfect Binary Tree

**Definition:** All internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

**Characteristics:**
- All levels are completely filled
- Symmetrical structure
- Rare in practice but useful for analysis

## 4. Balanced Binary Tree

**Definition:** Height difference between left and right subtrees is kept within a small constant factor.

**Characteristics:**
- Maintains relatively even height
- Requires balancing operations
- Provides consistent performance
