## Problem 2: Binary Search Complexity Analysis

Determine the time complexity and space complexity for the `binarySearch` function below. Justify your answer.

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Time Complexity: O(log n)**

Binary search eliminates half of the remaining elements in each iteration:
- Start with `n` elements
- After 1st iteration: `n/2` elements remain
- After 2nd iteration: `n/4` elements remain
- After k iterations: `n/2^k` elements remain
- We stop when `n/2^k ≤ 1`, so `k ≤ log₂(n)`

**Space Complexity: O(1)**

The function uses only a constant amount of extra space (`left`, `right`, `mid` variables), regardless of input size.

**Justification:**
Binary search is efficient because it leverages the sorted nature of the array to eliminate half the search space in each step, resulting in logarithmic time complexity.
