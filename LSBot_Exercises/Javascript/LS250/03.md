## Problem 3: Stack vs Queue

Explain the primary differences between a Stack and a Queue. Describe a common real-world analogy or a programming use case for each data structure.

**Primary Differences:**

**Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out):**
- Elements are added and removed from the same end (top)
- Operations: `push()` (add to top), `pop()` (remove from top), `peek()` (view top)
- Access pattern: Only the top element is directly accessible

**Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out):**
- Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front)
- Operations: `enqueue()` (add to rear), `dequeue()` (remove from front), `peek()` (view front)
- Access pattern: Only the front and rear elements are directly accessible

**Real-World Analogies:**

**Stack:**
- **Plate stack**: You can only add/remove plates from the top
- **Undo functionality**: Most recent action is undone first
- **Function call stack**: Most recently called function returns first

**Queue:**
- **Line at a store**: First person in line is served first
- **Print queue**: Documents are printed in the order they were sent
- **Task scheduling**: Tasks are processed in the order they arrive

**Programming Use Cases:**

**Stack:**
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing
- Undo operations in text editors
- Browser back button functionality
- Recursive function calls

**Queue:**
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) in graph algorithms
- Task scheduling in operating systems
- Handling requests in web servers
- Buffer for data streams
