## Problem 4: Arrays vs Singly Linked Lists

Compare and contrast Arrays and Singly Linked Lists in terms of their memory layout and the time complexity of the following operations:

1. Accessing an element by its index
2. Inserting an element at the beginning
3. Deleting an element from the end

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Memory Layout:**

**Arrays:**
- Elements stored in contiguous memory blocks
- Fixed size (in most languages) or dynamic with reallocation
- Direct memory addressing possible

**Singly Linked Lists:**
- Elements stored in non-contiguous memory locations
- Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node
- Dynamic size, no memory waste

**Time Complexity Comparison:**

| Operation | Array | Singly Linked List |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Access by index** | O(1) | O(n) |
| **Insert at beginning** | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Delete from end** | O(1) | O(n) |

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. Accessing an element by its index:**
- **Array**: O(1) - Direct memory access using base address + (index Ã— element size)
- **Linked List**: O(n) - Must traverse from head to the desired index

**2. Inserting an element at the beginning:**
- **Array**: O(n) - Must shift all existing elements to the right
- **Linked List**: O(1) - Create new node, point it to current head, update head pointer

**3. Deleting an element from the end:**
- **Array**: O(1) - Simply decrement length counter
- **Linked List**: O(n) - Must traverse to the second-to-last node to update its next pointer

**Trade-offs:**
- Arrays excel at random access but struggle with insertions/deletions
- Linked lists excel at insertions/deletions but require traversal for access
