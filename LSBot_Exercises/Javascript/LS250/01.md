## Problem 1: Time and Space Complexity Analysis

What is the time complexity and space complexity of the following `calculateSum` function? Explain your reasoning.

```javascript
function calculateSum(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
      sum += arr[i] + arr[j];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Time Complexity: O(n²)**

The function has nested loops:
- Outer loop runs `n` times (where `n = arr.length`)
- Inner loop runs `n-i` times for each iteration of the outer loop
- Total iterations: n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n+1)/2 = O(n²)

**Space Complexity: O(1)**

The function only uses a constant amount of extra space (`sum` variable), regardless of input size.

**Explanation:**
The nested loops create a triangular pattern where the inner loop's iterations decrease as `i` increases. This results in quadratic time complexity.
