## Problem 2: Creating Tables with Constraints

**Coding**: Write a SQL statement to create a table named `products` with the following columns and constraints:

- `id`: An auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key.
- `name`: A variable-length string that cannot be null.
- `price`: A numeric value with a precision of 10 and 2 decimal places, which must be greater than 0.
- `on_sale`: A boolean value that defaults to `false`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC(10, 2) CHECK (price > 0),
  on_sale BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
```
