## Problem 4: Multi-Table Joins

**Coding**: You have three tables: `students` (`id`, `name`), `courses` (`id`, `title`), and a join table `enrollments` (`student_id`, `course_id`). Write a SQL query to find the names of all students enrolled in the 'Calculus II' course.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

```sql
SELECT s.name
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id
WHERE c.title = 'Calculus II';
```

</details>
