## Problem 6: Instance Variable Mutability

In the code below, we hope to output `BOB` on the last line. Instead, we get the original name. Why? How could we adjust this code to output `BOB`?

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def change_name(self):
        name = self.name.upper()

bob = Person('Bob')
print(bob.name)
bob.change_name()
print(bob.name)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The problem is that `change_name` creates a local variable `name` instead of reassigning the instance variable `self.name`. Since strings are immutable in Python, calling `.upper()` returns a new string, which is assigned to the local variable `name`, not to `self.name`.

To fix this and output `BOB`, we need to assign the result back to the instance variable:

```python
def change_name(self):
    self.name = self.name.upper()
```

This demonstrates the importance of using `self` when you want to modify an instance variable.
