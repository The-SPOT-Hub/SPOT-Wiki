## Problem 2: Instance Variables and State

What is output and why? What does this demonstrate about instance variables?

```python
class Swimmable:
    def enable_swimming(self):
        self._can_swim = True

class Dog(Swimmable):
    def swim(self):
        if hasattr(self, '_can_swim') and self._can_swim:
            return "swimming!"
        return None

teddy = Dog()
print(teddy.swim())
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output is `None`. The `enable_swimming` method, which sets the `_can_swim` instance variable, is never called on the `teddy` object. Therefore, the `hasattr(self, '_can_swim')` condition in the swim method evaluates to `False`, and the method returns `None`. This demonstrates that instance variables define the state of an object and must be initialized or set for an object to have that specific state.
