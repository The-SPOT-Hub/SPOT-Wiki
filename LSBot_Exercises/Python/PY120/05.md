## Problem 5: Local vs. Instance Variables

We expect the code below to output `"Spartacus weighs 45 lbs and is 24 inches tall."` Why does our `change_info` method not work as expected?

```python
class GoodDog:
    def __init__(self, n, h, w):
        self.name = n
        self.height = h
        self.weight = w

    def change_info(self, n, h, w):
        name = n
        height = h
        weight = w

    def info(self):
        return f"{self.name} weighs {self.weight} and is {self.height} tall."

sparky = GoodDog('Spartacus', '12 inches', '10 lbs')
sparky.change_info('Spartacus', '24 inches', '45 lbs')
print(sparky.info())
# => Spartacus weighs 10 lbs and is 12 inches tall.
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `change_info` method doesn't work as expected because it creates local variables (`name`, `height`, `weight`) instead of modifying the instance variables (`self.name`, `self.height`, `self.weight`). 

Local variables only exist within the scope of the method and are discarded when the method completes. The instance variables remain unchanged.

To fix this, we need to use `self` to reference the instance variables:

```python
def change_info(self, n, h, w):
    self.name = n
    self.height = h
    self.weight = w
```
