## Problem 12: Collaborator Objects

We raise an error in the code below. Why? What do `kitty` and `bud` represent in relation to our `Person` object?

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.pets = []

class Pet:
    def jump(self):
        print("I'm Jumping!")

class Cat(Pet):
    pass

class Bulldog(Pet):
    pass

bob = Person("Robert")
kitty = Cat()
bud = Bulldog()
bob.pets.append(kitty)
bob.pets.append(bud)
bob.pets.jump()
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The error occurs because we're trying to call `jump()` on a list object (`bob.pets`), not on the individual `Pet` objects within the list. Lists don't have a `jump()` method.

To fix this, we need to call `jump()` on each individual pet:

```python
for pet in bob.pets:
    pet.jump()
```

Or for individual pets:
```python
bob.pets[0].jump()  # kitty jumps
bob.pets[1].jump()  # bud jumps
```

**What do `kitty` and `bud` represent?**

`kitty` and `bud` are **collaborator objects**. They are objects of other classes (`Cat` and `Bulldog`) that are stored as part of the state of a `Person` object. The `Person` class collaborates with `Pet` objects (and its subclasses) to fulfill its responsibilities.

This is an example of **composition** or **"has-a" relationship**: a `Person` "has" pets. The `Person` object's behavior and state depend on collaborating with other objects. This is different from inheritance ("is-a" relationship) and is a fundamental way objects work together in object-oriented programming.
