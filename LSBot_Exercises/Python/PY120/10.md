## Problem 10: Method Resolution Order

What is the method lookup path used when invoking `walk()` on `good_dog`?

```python
class Walkable:
    def walk(self):
        return "I'm walking."

class Swimmable:
    def swim(self):
        return "I'm swimming."

class Climbable:
    def climb(self):
        return "I'm climbing."

class Danceable:
    def dance(self):
        return "I'm dancing."

class Animal(Walkable):
    def speak(self):
        return "I'm an animal, and I speak!"

class GoodAnimals:
    class GoodDog(Animal, Swimmable, Danceable):
        pass

good_dog = GoodAnimals.GoodDog()
print(good_dog.walk())
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The method lookup path (Method Resolution Order or MRO) when invoking `walk()` on `good_dog` is:

1. `GoodAnimals.GoodDog` - the class of the object itself
2. `Animal` - first parent class listed in `GoodDog(Animal, Swimmable, Danceable)`
3. `Walkable` - parent class of `Animal`
4. `Swimmable` - second parent class of `GoodDog`
5. `Danceable` - third parent class of `GoodDog`
6. `object` - the base class of all Python classes

Python searches for the `walk()` method starting with `GoodDog`, then moves to `Animal`, then to `Walkable` where it finds the method. The search stops there and the method is invoked.

You can verify the exact MRO by calling:
```python
print(GoodAnimals.GoodDog.__mro__)
```

This demonstrates Python's MRO, which determines the order in which parent classes are searched when looking for methods and attributes. The order respects the inheritance hierarchy and the order in which parent classes are listed.
