## 10: Method Resolution Order

What is the method lookup path used when invoking `walk()` on `good_dog`?

```Python
class Walkable:
    def walk(self):
        return "I'm walking."

class Swimmable:
    def swim(self):
        return "I'm swimming."

class Climbable:
    def climb(self):
        return "I'm climbing."

class Danceable:
    def dance(self):
        return "I'm dancing."

class Animal(Walkable):
    def speak(self):
        return "I'm an animal, and I speak!"

class GoodAnimals:
    class GoodDog(Animal, Swimmable, Danceable):
        pass

good_dog = GoodAnimals.GoodDog()
print(good_dog.walk())
```
