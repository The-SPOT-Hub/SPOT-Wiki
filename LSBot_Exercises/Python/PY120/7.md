## 7: Class Variables vs. Inheritance
What does the code below output, and why? What does this demonstrate about class variables, and why we should avoid using class variables when working with inheritance?

```Python
class Vehicle:
    _wheels = 4

    @classmethod
    def wheels(cls):
        return cls._wheels

print(Vehicle.wheels())

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    _wheels = 2

print(Motorcycle.wheels())
print(Vehicle.wheels())

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass

print(Vehicle.wheels())
print(Motorcycle.wheels())
print(Car.wheels())
```
