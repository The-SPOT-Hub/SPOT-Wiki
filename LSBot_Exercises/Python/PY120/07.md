## Problem 7: Class Variables vs. Inheritance

What does the code below output, and why? What does this demonstrate about class variables, and why we should avoid using class variables when working with inheritance?

```python
class Vehicle:
    _wheels = 4

    @classmethod
    def wheels(cls):
        return cls._wheels

print(Vehicle.wheels())

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    _wheels = 2

print(Motorcycle.wheels())
print(Vehicle.wheels())

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass

print(Vehicle.wheels())
print(Motorcycle.wheels())
print(Car.wheels())
```

The output is:
```
4
2
4
4
2
4
```

This demonstrates several important points about class variables and inheritance:

1. `Vehicle.wheels()` returns `4` - the value of the `_wheels` class variable in `Vehicle`.
2. `Motorcycle.wheels()` returns `2` - `Motorcycle` defines its own `_wheels` class variable, which shadows the parent's.
3. `Vehicle.wheels()` still returns `4` - the parent class variable is unchanged.
4. `Car.wheels()` returns `4` - since `Car` doesn't define its own `_wheels`, it inherits from `Vehicle`.

The potential problem with class variables in inheritance hierarchies is that if a subclass doesn't define its own class variable, it will inherit the parent's value. This can lead to unexpected behavior when you expect each class to have independent values. Additionally, reassigning a class variable in a subclass doesn't modify the parent's variable - it creates a new variable that shadows the parent's. This can be confusing and error-prone.
