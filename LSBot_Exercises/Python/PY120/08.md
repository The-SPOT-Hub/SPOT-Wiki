## Problem 8: super() and __init__

What is output and why? What does this demonstrate about `super()`?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class GoodDog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, color):
        super().__init__(color)
        self.color = color

bruno = GoodDog("brown")
print(bruno)
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output will be something like `<__main__.GoodDog object at 0x...>`, which is the default object representation.

What's important to note is how `super().__init__(color)` works. When we create `bruno = GoodDog("brown")`:

1. `GoodDog.__init__` is called with `color="brown"`
2. `super().__init__(color)` calls the parent class `Animal.__init__` with `color` as the argument
3. In `Animal.__init__`, the parameter `name` receives the value `"brown"`, so `self.name = "brown"`
4. Then `self.color = "brown"` is set in `GoodDog.__init__`

So `bruno` has both `name` and `color` attributes set to `"brown"`.

This demonstrates that `super()` allows a subclass to call methods from its parent class. The `super().__init__(color)` call invokes the parent's `__init__` method, which is essential for proper initialization when using inheritance. Note that the parameter name in the parent's `__init__` (`name`) doesn't need to match what we pass in - it's positional.
