## Problem 1: Instance Variables

What is output and why? What does this demonstrate about instance variables that differentiates them from local variables?

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self._name = None

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    def set_name(self):
        self._name = 'Bob'

bob = Person()
print(bob.name)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The code outputs `None`. When the `Person` object `bob` is initialized, its `_name` instance variable is set to `None`. Since the `set_name` method is never called, the `_name` variable remains `None`. Accessing `bob.name` via the `@property` decorator returns the current value of the `_name` instance variable. This demonstrates that instance variables are tied to a specific object instance, retaining their state throughout the object's lifecycle. In contrast, local variables exist only within the scope of the method they are defined in.
