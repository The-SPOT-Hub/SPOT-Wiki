## Problem 3: Class Variables and Inheritance

What is output and why? What does this demonstrate about constant scope? What does self refer to in each of the 3 methods above?

```python
class Describable:
    def describe_shape(self):
        return f"I am a {self.__class__.__name__} and have {self.SIDES} sides."

class Shape(Describable):
    @classmethod
    def sides(cls):
        return cls.SIDES

    def sides_instance(self):
        return self.__class__.SIDES

class Quadrilateral(Shape):
    SIDES = 4

class Square(Quadrilateral):
    pass

print(Square.sides())
print(Square().sides_instance())
print(Square().describe_shape())
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output is:
```
4
4
I am a Square and have 4 sides.
```

This demonstrates how class variables are inherited. The `SIDES` variable is defined on the `Quadrilateral` class. All subclasses, like `Square`, inherit this variable.

`Square.sides()`: This is a class method called on the `Square` class. The `cls` parameter refers to the `Square` class itself. The method finds the `SIDES` variable by walking up the inheritance hierarchy (MRO) until it finds it on `Quadrilateral`.

`Square().sides_instance()`: This is an instance method called on a Square object. The `self` parameter refers to the Square instance. `self.__class__` refers to the `Square` class, which then finds the inherited `SIDES` class variable.

`Square().describe_shape()`: This is an instance method inherited from the `Describable` class. `self` refers to the `Square` instance. `self.__class__.__name__` correctly returns "Square", and `self.SIDES` correctly finds the inherited class variable `SIDES`.
