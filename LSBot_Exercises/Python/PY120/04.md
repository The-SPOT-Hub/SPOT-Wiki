## Problem 4: __lshift__ and __add__ Magic Methods

What is output? Is this what we would expect when using `AnimalClass.__add__`? If not, how could we adjust the implementation of `AnimalClass.__add__` to be more in line with what we'd expect the method to return?

```python
class AnimalClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.animals = []

    def __lshift__(self, animal):
        self.animals.append(animal)
        return self

    def __add__(self, other_class):
        return self.animals + other_class.animals

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

mammals = AnimalClass('Mammals')
mammals << Animal('Human')
mammals << Animal('Dog')
mammals << Animal('Cat')
birds = AnimalClass('Birds')
birds << Animal('Eagle')
birds << Animal('Blue Jay')
birds << Animal('Penguin')
some_animal_classes = mammals + birds
print(some_animal_classes)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output is a list of `Animal` objects: `[<Animal object at ...>, <Animal object at ...>, ...]`

This is not what we would typically expect when adding two `AnimalClass` objects together. When using the `+` operator, we would normally expect to get a new `AnimalClass` object containing all the animals from both classes, not just a plain list.

To make this more intuitive, we could adjust the `__add__` method:

```python
def __add__(self, other_class):
    new_class = AnimalClass(f"{self.name} and {other_class.name}")
    new_class.animals = self.animals + other_class.animals
    return new_class
```

This way, `mammals + birds` would return a new `AnimalClass` object containing all animals from both classes.
