WSGI is a standard interface specification for Python that defines how a web server communicates with a Python web application or framework. It solves the problem of portability and interoperability. Before WSGI, different web frameworks used different conventions to connect to web servers, which meant a framework was often tied to a specific server. WSGI creates a universal standard, allowing developers to choose any WSGI-compliant web server (like Gunicorn or uWSGI) to run any WSGI-compliant framework (like Flask or Django) without modification.
