## Problem 9: RESTful Route Design

A view function needs to handle both displaying a form (GET request) and processing the form's submission (POST request). The developer wrote two separate routes. While this might work, it's not the standard pattern. What is the bug or design flaw here, and how would you refactor it into a single route?

```python
# Problematic Code
@app.route('/new-item')
def new_item_form():
    return render_template('new_item.html')

@app.route('/create-item', methods=['POST'])
def create_item():
    # process form data from request.form
    return redirect(url_for('item_list'))
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The design flaw is that two separate URLs are used for one logical action (creating a new item). The standard RESTful pattern is to use the same URL but different HTTP methods. The GET request to `/new-item` shows the resource creation form, and the POST request to that same URL should perform the creation. This keeps the URL structure cleaner and more intuitive.

**The refactored code would look like this:**

```python
# Refactored Code
@app.route('/item/new', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def new_item():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # process form data from request.form
        return redirect(url_for('item_list'))
    else: # This is a GET request
        return render_template('new_item.html')
```

</details>
