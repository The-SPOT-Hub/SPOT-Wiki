## Problem 2: Server-side vs Client-side Code

Explain the difference between server-side code and client-side code in the context of a Flask application.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

- **Server-side code** refers to the Python code (the Flask application itself) that runs on the server. It handles incoming HTTP requests, processes data, interacts with databases (in later courses), and generates the HTTP response, often by rendering an HTML template. The client (browser) never sees this code.

- **Client-side code** refers to code that is executed by the client's web browser. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This code is sent from the server as part of the HTTP response and is responsible for the structure, styling, and interactive behavior of the web page in the browser.
