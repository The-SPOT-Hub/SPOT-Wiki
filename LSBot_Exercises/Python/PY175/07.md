## Problem 7: Static File Linking

A developer is trying to link a stylesheet in their Jinja2 template with the following HTML tag: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="static/style.css">`. When they run the application, the CSS styles are not applied. What is the mistake and how should they fix it?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The mistake is that the `href` attribute is hardcoded. Flask serves static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) from a special folder (usually named `static`) through a dedicated endpoint. The correct way to generate the URL for a static file is to use the `url_for()` helper function.

**The fix is to change the line to:**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
```

This ensures that Flask generates the correct path to the file, regardless of how the application is deployed.
