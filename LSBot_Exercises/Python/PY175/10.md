## Problem 10: Safe Form Data Access

A developer's application crashes with a `KeyError` when trying to access a form field (`request.form['username']`) on a route that accepts both GET and POST methods. The error happens when the user first visits the page. Why does this error occur and what is the correct way to safely access form data?

Think about when `request.form` is populated. What happens when a user first visits a page (GET request) versus when they submit a form (POST request)?

The `KeyError` occurs because `request.form` is only populated on a POST request that includes form data. When the user first visits the page, they are making a GET request. At that time, `request.form` is an empty dictionary-like object. Trying to access the key `'username'` with square bracket notation (`[]`) on an empty dictionary raises a `KeyError`.

The correct and safe way to access form data that might not exist is to use the `.get()` method, which returns `None` (or a specified default value) if the key is not found, preventing the crash. The logic should also be inside a conditional block that checks if the request method is POST.

```python
# Correct Way
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Safely access the username. If it doesn't exist, username will be None.
        username = request.form.get('username')
        if username:
            # process login
            pass
        else:
            # handle missing username
            pass
    # For a GET request, this block is skipped, preventing the error.
    return render_template('login.html')
```
