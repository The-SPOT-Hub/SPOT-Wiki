## Problem 36: String Formatting Methods

Can you write the code necessary to get the desired output shown on the last line? Write two distinct solutions and explain the tools each uses.

```python
make = 'Ford'
model = 'Ranger'
year = 1995

sentence = ???

print(sentence)
# Look! It's a 1995 Ford Ranger!
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Is there a benefit to using one method over the other?
2. Is there any type coercion happening in this code?
3. If we change the values referenced by `make`, `model`, or `year` after `sentence` has been initialized, will the sentence be updated?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
# Concatenation
sentence = "Look! It's a " + str(year) + " " + make + " " + model + "!"

# F-string
sentence = f"Look! It's a {year} {make} {model}!"
```

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: F-string is preferred due to better readability and performance.

**Bonus 2**: Yes, explicit with string concatenation (using `str(year)`), implicit in f-string.

**Bonus 3**: No, strings are immutable. We create a new string unrelated to our variables when we use either method.
