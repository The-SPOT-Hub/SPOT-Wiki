## Problem 43: Do We Mutate Variables?

Do we **mutate** variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, we don't mutate variables. Variables are just names that point to objects. We mutate the objects themselves, not the variables. Reassigning a variable makes it point to a different object, but that's not mutationâ€”it's reassignment.

For example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This mutates the list object, not the variable
my_list = [5, 6]   # This reassigns the variable to point to a different list
```
