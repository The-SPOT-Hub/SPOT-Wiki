## Problem 106: Shadowing with Same Values

What is output when we run this code and why?

```python
snack = 'french fries'
num = 1
  
def i_love_fries(num):
    print(f"I'll love {snack}, even when I'm {num * 100}!")

i_love_fries(num)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. It seems like this code works...is there variable shadowing here?
2. We see `num` 4 times in this snippet. Which `num` variables are the same, and what do they reference?
3. What happens if we add `global snack` as the first line of our function definition?

Output:
```
I'll love french fries, even when I'm 100!
```

The function parameter `num` shadows the global variable `num`. When we call `i_love_fries(num)`, we pass the global `num` (1) as an argument, which becomes the local `num` inside the function. The function then calculates `1 * 100 = 100`.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: Yes, there is variable shadowing here, even though both variables reference the same value (1). Variable shadowing involves the variables themselves, not the values they reference. The parameter `num` shadows the global `num`.

```python
# To illustrate:
snack = 'french fries'
num = 1
  
def i_love_fries(num):
    print(id(num))  # Memory address of parameter
    print(f"I'll love {snack}, even when I'm {num * 100}!")

print(id(num))  # Memory address of global
i_love_fries(num)
# Both will show same id because small integers are cached in Python,
# but they're still separate variables
```

**Bonus 2**: 
- Line 2 (`num = 1`): Global variable
- Line 4 (`def i_love_fries(num):`): Parameter (local variable)
- Line 5 (`num * 100`): Parameter (same as line 4)
- Line 7 (`i_love_fries(num)`): Global variable (same as line 2)

Lines 2 and 7 reference the global `num`. Lines 4 and 5 reference the parameter `num`.

**Bonus 3**: Nothing changes:

```python
snack = 'french fries'
num = 1
  
def i_love_fries(num):
    global snack  # No effect
    print(f"I'll love {snack}, even when I'm {num * 100}!")

i_love_fries(num)
# I'll love french fries, even when I'm 100!
```

We are only referencing `snack` to interpolate it (reading, not modifying), so `global` is unnecessary and has no effect.
