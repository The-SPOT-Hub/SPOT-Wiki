## Problem 83: Modifying Outside Variables

How can we *modify* variables defined *outside* of a function definition from within a function definition?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Using the `global` or `nonlocal` keywords.

- Use `global` to modify variables in the global (module) scope
- Use `nonlocal` to modify variables in an enclosing function's scope

Examples:
```python
# Using global:
counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter  # Declare we're modifying the global counter
    counter += 1

increment()
print(counter)  # 1
```

```python
# Using nonlocal:
def outer():
    count = 0
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal count  # Modify the count in outer()'s scope
        count += 1
        print(count)
    
    inner()  # 1
    inner()  # 2

outer()
```

Note: You can mutate mutable objects (like lists) without these keywords, but you need them for reassignment.
