## Problem 80: Check Eligibility with Logical Operators

Implement `check_eligibility` such that we get the expected output. To be 'eligible', users must be at least 18. Users must be a member. If they are not a member then they must have filled out a survey.

```python
def check_eligibility(age, is_member, completed_survey):
    pass

# Example usage:
check_eligibility(20, True, False)  # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(17, True, True)   # "Not Eligible!"
check_eligibility(25, False, True)  # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(30, False, False) # "Not Eligible!"
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Expand on our function so that if a user is a member *and* they filled out a survey, they are eligible, and they get a discount. Then, add a `day` argument that makes anyone eligible on Fridays.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def check_eligibility(age, is_member, completed_survey):
    if age >= 18 and (is_member or completed_survey):
        print("Eligible!")
    else:
        print("Not Eligible!")

# Example usage:
check_eligibility(20, True, False)  # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(17, True, True)   # "Not Eligible!"
check_eligibility(25, False, True)  # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(30, False, False) # "Not Eligible!"
```

**Explanation of the logic:**
- `age >= 18` must be true
- AND either `is_member` OR `completed_survey` must be true

**Bonus Challenge Answer:**

```python
def check_eligibility(age, is_member, completed_survey, day=None):
    # Friday makes everyone eligible
    if day == "Friday":
        print("Eligible!")
        return
    
    # Must be at least 18
    if age < 18:
        print("Not Eligible!")
        return
    
    # Member and completed survey = eligible with discount
    if is_member and completed_survey:
        print("Eligible with discount!")
        return
    
    # Must be member OR have completed survey
    if is_member or completed_survey:
        print("Eligible!")
    else:
        print("Not Eligible!")

# Test cases:
check_eligibility(20, True, False)           # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(20, True, True)            # "Eligible with discount!"
check_eligibility(17, True, True, "Friday")  # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(30, False, False, "Friday") # "Eligible!"
check_eligibility(30, False, False, "Monday") # "Not Eligible!"
```

Alternative using single conditional:
```python
def check_eligibility(age, is_member, completed_survey, day=None):
    if day == "Friday" or (age >= 18 and (is_member or completed_survey)):
        if day != "Friday" and is_member and completed_survey:
            print("Eligible with discount!")
        else:
            print("Eligible!")
    else:
        print("Not Eligible!")
```
