## Problem 108: Default Parameter Shadowing

Explain what happens when this code executes. What does `counter` reference within the function?

```python
counter = 4

def skip_rocks(counter=0):
    while counter < 3:
        print(f"I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped {counter} times!")
        counter += 1

skip_rocks()
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Is the `counter` on line 3 the same as the `counter` on line 1?
2. What happens if we get rid of the `counter=0` parameter?
3. What happens if we fix this code such that we *can* access `counter` from line 1?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

When run, we use the default value of `counter` (0), which shadows the global `counter` (4).

Output:
```
I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped 0 times!
I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped 1 times!
I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped 2 times!
```

The parameter `counter` with default value `0` creates a local variable that shadows the global `counter`. Since no argument is provided when calling `skip_rocks()`, the default value (0) is used.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: No. They are two different variables. The parameter `counter` (line 3) is a local variable that shadows the global `counter` (line 1).

**Bonus 2**: We will attempt to use the `counter` variable from the global scope, but attempting to use augmented assignment will throw an error:

```python
counter = 4

def skip_rocks():
    while counter < 3:  # This line checks the condition first
        print(f"I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped {counter} times!")
        counter += 1  # UnboundLocalError happens here

skip_rocks()
```

Python knows that we are trying to use augmented assignment (`counter += 1`), so it treats `counter` as local. But then when it tries to evaluate `while counter < 3`, it finds that the local `counter` hasn't been initialized yet, causing an `UnboundLocalError`.

Actually, Python performs this check before executing any code, so we get the error immediately.

**Bonus 3**: We could eliminate the default parameter and use `global`, but this still wouldn't print anything because `counter` starts out as greater than `3`:

```python
counter = 4

def skip_rocks():
    global counter
    while counter < 3:  # 4 < 3 is False, so loop never runs
        print(f"I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped {counter} times!")
        counter += 1

skip_rocks()
# (no output because the while condition is never true)
```

If we wanted it to actually run, we'd need to change the initial value:
```python
counter = 0  # Start at 0

def skip_rocks():
    global counter
    while counter < 3:
        print(f"I'm skippin' rocks. This rock skipped {counter} times!")
        counter += 1

skip_rocks()
```
