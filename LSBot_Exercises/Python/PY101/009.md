## Problem 9

What is the output of this code, and why? What is the concept covered here?

```python
str1 = "Hello, world!"
sub1 = str1[8:12]
print(sub1)
sub2 = str1[::-1]
print(sub2)
sub3 = str1[::2]
print(sub3)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The concept is string slicing, which creates a new string object (a substring) from the original string object based on the given indexing sequence and the step slice argument, if any. `sub1` returns the characters from and inclusive of index `8` to but exclusive of index `12`, or the string `"worl"`, which is then printed. The substring `sub2` returns the entire string, but the slice step argument of `-1` reverses the order of the indexing, returning the string reversed, or `"!dlrow ,olleH"`, which is then printed. The last substring `sub3` returns the entire original string, but the slice step argument of `2` instructs the indexing to skip every other index starting with index `0`. The new substring has a value of `"Hlo ol!"`, which is then printed.
