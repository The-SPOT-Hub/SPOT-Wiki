## Problem 78: DRY Configuration Validation

How can we rewrite this code to be more DRY using knowledge of precedence and logical operators? Refer to the current invocations to understand the expected behavior.

```python
def validate_game_config(name, rounds, difficulty, use_defaults):
    if use_defaults:
        print("Welcome to Asteroid! Let's play!")
        return
    elif name == '':
        print("You need to fill in all fields!")
        return
    elif rounds < 1:
        print("You need to fill in all fields!")
        return
    elif difficulty == '':
        print("You need to fill in all fields!")
        return
    else:
        print("Welcome to Asteroid! Let's play!")

validate_game_config('Jack', 0, 'Hard', False)
validate_game_config('', 0, '', True)
validate_game_config('Jack', 3, 'Hard', False)
validate_game_config('Jack', 3, 'Hard', True)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Write an alternative version with as few lines as possible. Is this better?
2. Make this function sturdier by throwing an error if the `name` and `difficulty` aren't strings.
3. Make the "Let's play!" message custom by including the given arguments in the output.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def validate_game_config(name, rounds, difficulty, use_defaults):
    if use_defaults or (name and rounds >= 1 and difficulty):
        print("Welcome to Asteroid! Let's play!")
    else:
        print("You need to fill in all fields!")

validate_game_config('Jack', 0, 'Hard', False)
validate_game_config('', 0, '', True)
validate_game_config('Jack', 3, 'Hard', False)
validate_game_config('Jack', 3, 'Hard', True)
```

This version uses short-circuiting: if `use_defaults` is `True`, the entire condition is `True` and we don't check the other fields.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: Most compact version:
```python
def validate_game_config(name, rounds, difficulty, use_defaults):
    print("Welcome to Asteroid! Let's play!" if use_defaults or (name and rounds >= 1 and difficulty) else "You need to fill in all fields!")
```

This is more compact but arguably less readable. The previous version strikes a better balance.

**Bonus 2**: Adding type validation:
```python
def validate_game_config(name, rounds, difficulty, use_defaults):
    if not isinstance(name, str) or not isinstance(difficulty, str):
        raise TypeError("Name and difficulty must be strings!")
    
    if use_defaults or (name and rounds >= 1 and difficulty):
        print("Welcome to Asteroid! Let's play!")
    else:
        print("You need to fill in all fields!")
```

**Bonus 3**: Custom message with arguments:
```python
def validate_game_config(name, rounds, difficulty, use_defaults):
    if use_defaults or (name and rounds >= 1 and difficulty):
        if use_defaults:
            print("Welcome to Asteroid! Let's play!")
        else:
            print(f"Welcome to Asteroid, {name}! You'll play {rounds} rounds at {difficulty} difficulty. Let's play!")
    else:
        print("You need to fill in all fields!")
```
