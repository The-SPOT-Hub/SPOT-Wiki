## Problem 33: Assignment vs Equality

What's the difference between `=` and `==`?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- `=` is the assignment operator, used to assign a value to a variable (e.g., `x = 5`).
- `==` is the equality operator, used to compare two values for equality (e.g., `x == 5` checks if `x` is equal to `5`).
