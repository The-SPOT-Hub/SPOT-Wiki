## Problem 77: Short-Circuit and Index Error

What will happen when we run the following code? Explain the steps taken.

```python
def foo():
    print("foo was called")
    return False

def bar():
    print("bar was called")
    return True

result = foo() and bar() and [][3]
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. How does the answer change if `foo()` returns `True` instead of `False`?
2. What happens if `foo` returns `True` and `bar` returns `False`?
3. How does our answer change if we replace the `and`s with `or`s?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output will be:
```
foo was called
```

And `result` will be `False`.

**Explanation:**

1. `foo()` is called first, printing "foo was called" and returning `False`
2. Because the first operand is falsy, the `and` operator short-circuits
3. `bar()` is never called
4. `[][3]` is never evaluated (which would have raised an `IndexError`)
5. `result` is assigned the value `False` (the first falsy operand)

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: If `foo()` returns `True`, the execution would be:
- `foo()` is called → prints "foo was called"
- `bar()` is called → prints "bar was called" and returns `True`
- `[][3]` is evaluated → raises an `IndexError: list index out of range`

**Bonus 2**: If `foo` returns `True` and `bar` returns `False`:
- `foo()` is called → prints "foo was called"
- `bar()` is called → prints "bar was called" and returns `False`
- Short-circuits at `bar()`'s `False` result
- `[][3]` is never evaluated
- `result` is `False`

**Bonus 3**: If we replace `and` with `or`:
```python
result = foo() or bar() or [][3]
```
- `foo()` is called → prints "foo was called" and returns `False`
- `bar()` is called → prints "bar was called" and returns `True`
- Short-circuits at `bar()`'s `True` result (first truthy value)
- `[][3]` is never evaluated
- `result` is `True`
