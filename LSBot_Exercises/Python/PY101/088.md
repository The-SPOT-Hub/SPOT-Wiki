## Problem 88: Using Global Variables Without `global`

What can we do with global variables *without* using the `global` keyword?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You can read or access global variables without using the `global` keyword, but you cannot reassign them.

Examples:
```python
# Reading global variables (no 'global' needed):
message = "Hello"
count = 5

def display():
    print(message)  # Can read global variables
    print(count * 2)  # Can use them in expressions

display()
```

```python
# You can also call methods on global objects:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

def show_list():
    print(my_list)       # Can read
    print(len(my_list))  # Can use in function calls
    # But can't do: my_list = [4, 5, 6]  # Would create local variable

show_list()
```

```python
# What you CAN'T do without 'global':
counter = 0

def increment():
    counter += 1  # UnboundLocalError!
    # Python sees assignment and assumes counter is local
    # But then tries to read it before it's defined

# increment()  # This would error
```
