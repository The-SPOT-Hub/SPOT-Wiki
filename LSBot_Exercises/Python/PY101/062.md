## Problem 62: Bad Math Function

Explain the following code, and identify the output. Is this code running as expected?

```python
def bad_math(num=42):
    if num:
        print('It\'s 42')
    else:
        print('It\'s not 42')

bad_math(42)
```

> ðŸ’¡ What does it mean for code to 'run as expected'?

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What happens if we pass a falsy value into `bad_math`?
2. What if we don't pass an argument into `bad_math`?
3. Based on the strings being printed, how could we change this problem to get the desired functionality?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The code outputs: `It's 42`

However, the code is **not** running as expected. The function checks if `num` is truthy, not if it equals `42`. Any truthy value will print "It's 42", even if it's not actually `42`.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: If we pass a falsy value (like `0`, `""`, `None`, etc.), it will print "It's not 42", even though `0` is not `42`.

**Bonus 2**: If we don't pass an argument, the default value `42` is used, so it prints "It's 42".

**Bonus 3**: We should change the condition to `if num == 42:` to check for actual equality rather than truthiness.
