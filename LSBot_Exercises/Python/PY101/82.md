## Problem 82: Accessing Outside Variables

How can we *access* variables that are defined *outside* of a function definition from *within* a function definition?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

As normal. You can access (read) variables from outer scopes without any special keywords.

Python looks for variables in the following order (LEGB rule):
1. **L**ocal scope (inside the function)
2. **E**nclosing scope (outer functions)
3. **G**lobal scope (module level)
4. **B**uilt-in scope (Python's built-in names)

Examples:
```python
global_var = "I'm global!"

def my_function():
    print(global_var)  # Can access global_var directly
    
my_function()  # Prints: I'm global!
```

```python
x = 10
y = 20

def calculate():
    result = x + y  # Can read both x and y
    return result

print(calculate())  # 30
```
