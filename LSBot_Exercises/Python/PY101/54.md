## Problem 54: Things Without Truthiness

What are some things in Python that *don't* have truthiness?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Statements like `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, and `class`. Anything that isn't an expression doesn't have truthiness.

Only expressions (things that evaluate to a value) have truthiness. Statements are instructions that perform actions but don't evaluate to a value.

For example:
```python
# You can't do this:
# if (if x > 5):  # Error! 'if' is a statement, not an expression

# But you can do this:
if (x > 5):  # 'x > 5' is an expression that evaluates to True or False
    print("Yes")
```
