## Problem 58: Is Everything an Expression?

Is everything in Python an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, not everything in Python is an expression.

Statements perform actions but don't evaluate to values. They're instructions that control the flow of your program or define structures.

Examples of things that are NOT expressions:
```python
# Statements (not expressions):
if x > 5:           # if statement
    pass
    
for i in range(5):  # for loop
    pass
    
def my_func():      # function definition
    pass
    
class MyClass:      # class definition
    pass

# But these ARE expressions:
x > 5              # Comparison expression
range(5)           # Function call expression
```
