## Problem 123: Multiple Concepts in One Snippet

What do we do if a snippet is demonstrating multiple concepts?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

When a snippet demonstrates multiple concepts, you should:

1. **Identify the primary concept** - What is the main point of the code?
2. **Mention secondary concepts** if they're important to understanding the behavior
3. **Be clear about which is which** in your explanation

**Example with multiple concepts:**

```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    def inner():
        print(x)
    inner()

outer()
```

**Primary concept:** Nested functions / Closures (inner function can access outer function's variables)

**Secondary concepts:** 
- Function scope
- Variable access from enclosing scope

**Good answer:**
```
This code demonstrates nested functions and closures. The inner 
function can access the variable x from the enclosing outer 
function's scope. This also demonstrates the concept of variable 
scope - specifically how inner scopes can access outer scopes.
```

**Another example:**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
other_list = my_list
other_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Primary concept:** Variables as pointers (both variables point to same object)

**Secondary concepts:**
- Mutability (lists can be changed)
- Pass by object reference

**Good answer:**
```
This demonstrates variables as pointers. Both my_list and 
other_list reference the same list object in memory. When we 
mutate the list through other_list, the change is visible 
through my_list because they point to the same object. This 
also demonstrates mutability - lists can be modified in place.
```

**Tips:**
- Don't try to name every concept you can think of
- Focus on what makes the code interesting or surprising
- The primary concept is usually what would be most difficult to understand for someone learning Python
