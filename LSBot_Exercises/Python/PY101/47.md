## Problem 47: Variables and List Elements

Predict the output of this snippet and explain why.

```python
num1 = 1
lst1 = [num1, 2, 3]

num1 = 42

print(lst1) # What is output by this line?

lst1[0] = 42

print(lst1) # What is output by this line?
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Does `lst1` contain the variable `num1` as an element?
2. Is there anything we can do to `num1` to change the value at index 0 in our list?
3. What could we do instead of line 9 (`lst1[0] = 42`) that would have the same outcome on line 11?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

First `print(lst1)` outputs: `[1, 2, 3]`

Second `print(lst1)` outputs: `[42, 2, 3]`

**Explanation:**

When we create `lst1 = [num1, 2, 3]`, the list stores a reference to the object that `num1` points to (the integer `1`), not the variable `num1` itself. When we reassign `num1 = 42`, this doesn't affect the list because the list still points to the original integer `1`.

On line 8, we directly mutate the list by changing the element at index 0 to `42`, which is why the second print shows `[42, 2, 3]`.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: No, `lst1` does not contain the variable `num1`. It contains a reference to the object that `num1` pointed to when the list was created (the integer `1`).

**Bonus 2**: No, there's nothing we can do to `num1` to change the value at index 0 in the list. Since integers are immutable and the list doesn't reference the variable `num1`, modifying `num1` has no effect on the list.

**Bonus 3**: We could use `lst1[0] += 41` or `lst1 = [42, 2, 3]` (though this is reassignment, not mutation).
