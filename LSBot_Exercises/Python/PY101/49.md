## Problem 49: Function Parameters and Reassignment

What does line 10 output and why? Explain what happens within `a_function` to explain this.

```python
def a_function(lst):
    lst = ['hello']
    return lst.append('world')


lst = ['hello']
a_function(lst)
print(lst)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What is the caller, argument, and return value of `append` in this code?
2. How many `lst` variables exist in this snippet?
3. How many lists exist after this code has run?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Line 10 outputs: `['hello']`

**Explanation:**

When `a_function(lst)` is called, the parameter `lst` initially points to the same list as the outer `lst` variable. However, on line 3, `lst = ['hello']` reassigns the parameter to point to a **new** list. This reassignment doesn't affect the original list that the outer `lst` variable points to.

The `append` operation happens on the new list (which becomes `['hello', 'world']`), but this new list is never assigned to anything, and the function returns `None` (the return value of `append`). The original list remains unchanged.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: 
- Caller: The new list `['hello']` created inside the function
- Argument: `'world'`
- Return value: `None`

**Bonus 2**: Two `lst` variables exist: one in the global scope and one as a parameter in the function's local scope.

**Bonus 3**: Two lists exist after the code has run:
- `['hello']` (the original list in global scope)
- `['hello', 'world']` (the list created in the function, though it's not referenced and may be garbage collected)
