## Problem 97: Reassignment vs Shadowing

Does reassigning a variable shadow the value it previously had?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No. Reassignment just changes the value the variable references. Shadowing requires two separate variables with the same name in different scopes.

Examples:
```python
# This is reassignment, NOT shadowing:
x = 10
x = 20  # Same variable, different value
print(x)  # 20

# This IS shadowing:
x = 10

def my_function():
    x = 20  # Different variable with the same name
    print(x)  # 20

my_function()
print(x)  # 10 - outer x is unchanged
```

The key difference:
- **Reassignment**: One variable changes its value
- **Shadowing**: Two different variables with the same name in different scopes
