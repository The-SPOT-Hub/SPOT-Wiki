## Problem 38: Match vs If/Elif

Write a code snippet that demonstrates a `match`/`case` statement and a code snippet that demonstrates an `if`/`elif` statement. The snippets should be functionally equivalent, and the `match` statement should use a `_` (default) branch. Then, explain which is preferable for the task you've created and why.

**Bonus Question:**

Do `case _` and `else` have the same functionality? Why or why not?

```python
def handle_fruit(fruit):
    match fruit:
        case "apple":
            print("This is an apple")
        case "banana":
            print("This is a banana")
        case _:
            print("Unknown fruit")

# Example Usage
handle_fruit("apple")  # Output: This is an apple
handle_fruit("banana") # Output: This is a banana
handle_fruit("cherry") # Output: Unknown fruit
```

```python
def handle_fruit(fruit):
    if fruit == "apple":
        print("This is an apple")
    elif fruit == "banana":
        print("This is a banana")
    else:
        print("Unknown fruit")

# Example Usage
handle_fruit("apple")  # Output: This is an apple
handle_fruit("banana") # Output: This is a banana
handle_fruit("cherry") # Output: Unknown fruit
```

**Bonus Answer:**

In our case, `else` and `case _` have the same functionality. A `match` statement is preferable here because we're repeating the same comparison over and over in our `if/elif` statement. In reality, `match` statements can do a lot more than this.
