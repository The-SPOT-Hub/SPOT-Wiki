## Problem 107: Creating and Accessing Globals

What happens when we run this code? Why?

```python
def set_status():
    global status
    status = '200 OK'

def print_status():
    print(status)

set_status()
print_status()
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What concept is being demonstrated by this snippet?
2. What would happen if we were to invoke `set_status` a second time before invoking `print_status`?
3. Why don't we need to use `global` in `print_status`?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Output:
```
200 OK
```

The `set_status` function declares and initializes a new global variable `status` using the `global` keyword. After invoking `set_status`, the global `status` variable exists and can be accessed from anywhere in the module, including from `print_status`.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: This demonstrates the creation of global variables with the `global` keyword. Even though `status` doesn't exist before the function is called, using `global` inside the function creates it in the global scope.

**Bonus 2**: We would get the same output:

```python
def set_status():
    global status
    status = '200 OK'

def print_status():
    print(status)

set_status()
set_status()  # Called again
print_status()  # 200 OK
```

We're simply reassigning `status` to `'200 OK'` again, which doesn't change anything since it already has that value.

**Bonus 3**: Because we can access global variables without using `global` - we just can't modify (reassign) them. The `global` keyword is only needed when you want to reassign a global variable. Reading or accessing global variables doesn't require `global`.

```python
# Reading doesn't need 'global':
value = 100

def read_value():
    print(value)  # Fine without 'global'

# Modifying needs 'global':
def modify_value():
    global value
    value = 200  # Need 'global' to reassign
```
