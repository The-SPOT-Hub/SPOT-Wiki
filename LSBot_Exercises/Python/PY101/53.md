## Problem 53: Truthy vs True

Is `truthy` an object? Is `True` an object?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Truthy is not an object. `True` is an object of type `bool`.

"Truthy" is a concept or descriptionâ€”it describes values that evaluate to `True` in a boolean context. `True` is an actual boolean object.

For example:
```python
# "hello" is truthy (it evaluates to True in boolean context)
# but "hello" is not the same as True
if "hello":  # This works because "hello" is truthy
    print("Truthy!")

print("hello" == True)  # False - "hello" is not True, just truthy
print(bool("hello"))    # True - when converted to bool, it becomes True
```
