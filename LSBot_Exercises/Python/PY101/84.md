## Problem 84: Accessing Variables from Outside Functions

How can we access variables that are defined within a function definition from outside of that definition?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You cannot. Use return values if needed.

Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and are destroyed when the function returns. The only way to get data out of a function is through return values.

Examples:
```python
def my_function():
    local_var = 42
    return local_var

result = my_function()
print(result)  # 42

# print(local_var)  # NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined
```

```python
def calculate_stats():
    total = 100
    average = 50
    return total, average  # Return multiple values as a tuple

total, avg = calculate_stats()
print(total, avg)  # 100 50
```

```python
# Can't access local variables:
def process():
    data = [1, 2, 3]
    # data is only available inside process()

process()
# print(data)  # NameError
```
