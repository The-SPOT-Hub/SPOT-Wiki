## Problem 44: Lists with Primitive Elements

Is a list that contains *only* primitive elements still mutable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, a list is always mutable regardless of what it contains. Even if a list contains only immutable primitive elements (like integers, strings, or booleans), the list itself can still be modifiedâ€”you can add, remove, or change elements.

For example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # Contains only immutable integers
my_list[0] = 10      # The list is mutated
my_list.append(4)    # The list is mutated
```

The immutability of the elements doesn't affect the mutability of the list itself.
