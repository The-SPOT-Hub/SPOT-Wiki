## Problem 15: String Case Methods

What do these print and why?

```python
stuff = 'tHIS iS bACKWARDS'
str1 = stuff.swapcase()
str2 = stuff.upper()
str3 = stuff.lower()
print(stuff)
print(str1)
print(str2)
print(str3)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output will be:
```
tHIS iS bACKWARDS
This Is Backwards
THIS IS BACKWARDS
this is backwards
```

The `print(stuff)` statement prints the original string without modification. The `.swapcase()` method returns a new string with the case of each character swapped. The `.upper()` method returns a new string with all characters converted to uppercase. The `.lower()` method returns a new string with all characters converted to lowercase.
