## Problem 75: Combining Multiple Logical Operators

Can we combine multiple `and` and `or` logical operators?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, you can combine multiple `and` and `or` logical operators in a single expression.

When combining them, remember that `and` has higher precedence than `or`, so `and` operations are evaluated first unless you use parentheses.

Examples:
```python
# Multiple 'and' operators:
result = True and True and False  # False
result = 1 and 2 and 3            # 3 (returns last value if all truthy)

# Multiple 'or' operators:
result = False or False or True   # True
result = 0 or "" or "hello"       # "hello" (returns first truthy)

# Combining 'and' and 'or':
result = True and False or True   # True (evaluated as (True and False) or True)
result = True or False and False  # True (evaluated as True or (False and False))

# Using parentheses for clarity:
result = (True or False) and False  # False
result = True or (False and False)  # True

# Practical example:
if (age >= 18 and has_license) or is_supervised:
    print("Can drive")
```
