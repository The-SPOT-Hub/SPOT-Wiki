## Problem 119: Reverse List In Place (Challenge)

**Super Challenging Problem!**

Given a list, reverse the elements of the list *in place*. You may not use any additional lists.

**Hint:** If you can't figure out where to start, try creating the function to work with lists of a fixed length, like 4 elements or 6.

```python
def reverse_in_place(lst):
    left = 0
    right = len(lst) - 1

    # Swap elements from the outer sides towards the center
    while left < right:
        lst[left], lst[right] = lst[right], lst[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

# Example usage:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reverse_in_place(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**How it works:**

1. Start with two pointers: `left` at the beginning (index 0) and `right` at the end (last index)
2. Swap the elements at these positions
3. Move `left` forward and `right` backward
4. Repeat until the pointers meet in the middle

**Step-by-step visualization:**
```python
Initial: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
         ↑           ↑
       left       right

Step 1: Swap 1 and 5
        [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
            ↑     ↑
          left  right

Step 2: Swap 2 and 4
        [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
               ↑
            (left == right, stop)
```

**Starting with fixed-length hint:**

```python
def reverse_fixed_4(lst):
    # Assuming the list has exactly 4 elements
    lst[0], lst[3] = lst[3], lst[0]  # Swap first and last
    lst[1], lst[2] = lst[2], lst[1]  # Swap second and third

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
reverse_fixed_4(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

```python
def reverse_fixed_6(lst):
    # Assuming the list has exactly 6 elements
    lst[0], lst[5] = lst[5], lst[0]  # Swap indices 0 and 5
    lst[1], lst[4] = lst[4], lst[1]  # Swap indices 1 and 4
    lst[2], lst[3] = lst[3], lst[2]  # Swap indices 2 and 3

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
reverse_fixed_6(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Pattern recognition:**
- 4 elements: swap 0↔3, 1↔2 (2 swaps)
- 6 elements: swap 0↔5, 1↔4, 2↔3 (3 swaps)
- n elements: swap i↔(n-1-i) for i from 0 to n//2

**Alternative solution using a for loop:**

```python
def reverse_in_place(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        # Swap element at i with element at (n - 1 - i)
        lst[i], lst[n - 1 - i] = lst[n - 1 - i], lst[i]

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
reverse_in_place(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Why this is challenging:**
- Must modify in place (can't create new list)
- Need to understand swapping without a temporary variable
- Must figure out when to stop (middle of list)
- Need to handle both even and odd-length lists

**Time complexity:** O(n/2) = O(n)
**Space complexity:** O(1) - no additional space used!
