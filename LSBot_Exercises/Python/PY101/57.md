## Problem 57: What is an Expression?

What does it mean for something to be an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

An expression is any piece of code that Python can evaluate to produce a value. When Python runs an expression, it results in a single value.

Examples of expressions:
```python
5 + 3                    # Evaluates to 8
"hello".upper()          # Evaluates to "HELLO"
x > 10                   # Evaluates to True or False
[1, 2, 3]               # Evaluates to a list
len([1, 2, 3])          # Evaluates to 3
x if x > 0 else -x      # Ternary expression, evaluates to a value
```
