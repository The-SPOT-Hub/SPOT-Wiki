## Problem 121: What Does "Demonstrating a Concept" Mean?

What does it mean for a code snippet to be 'demonstrating' a concept?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A code snippet "demonstrates" a concept when it shows that concept in action - when the behavior or output of the code is directly related to and explained by that concept.

**Key aspects:**

The concept being demonstrated is usually:
- The **main reason** the code behaves the way it does
- What you need to understand to **predict the output**
- The **core principle** the code is illustrating

**Examples:**

```python
# Demonstrating: Mutability
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
# The concept: Lists are mutable and can be changed in place
```

```python
# Demonstrating: Variable Shadowing
x = 10
def my_function(x):
    print(x)
my_function(5)  # 5
# The concept: Parameter x shadows the global x
```

```python
# Demonstrating: Pass by Object Reference
def modify(lst):
    lst.append(4)
    
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
# The concept: Functions receive references to objects
```

**What to look for:**
- What makes this code interesting or surprising?
- What core Python principle explains the behavior?
- What would a student need to understand to predict the output?
