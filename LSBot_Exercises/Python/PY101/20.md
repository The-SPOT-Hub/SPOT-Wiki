## Problem 20

What do these print and why?

```Python
name = 'HELLO'
if name.isupper():
    print("WORLD")
else:
    print("world")
```

This will print "WORLD". The `.isupper()` method returns `True` if all cased characters in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character. Since the string 'HELLO' meets this condition, the `if` block is executed, printing "WORLD".
