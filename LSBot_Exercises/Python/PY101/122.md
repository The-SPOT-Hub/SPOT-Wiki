## Problem 122: How to Identify Concepts

What things can we consider when deciding what concept is being demonstrated by a snippet?

**Key indicators to look for:**

1. **Output** - What is printed or returned? Why is it that value and not something else?

2. **Errors being thrown** - If code raises an error, what concept explains why?
   - `NameError` → Scope issues
   - `UnboundLocalError` → Global/local variable confusion
   - `TypeError` → Wrong number of arguments, immutability
   - `IndexError` → List access issues

3. **Comments** - Especially comments showing:
   - Expected output vs actual output
   - Questions about what will happen
   - Explanations of unexpected behavior

4. **Unexpected behavior** - When code doesn't do what you might first expect:
   - A variable doesn't change when you think it should
   - Multiple variables seem to affect each other
   - A value persists when you thought it would reset

**Examples:**

```python
# Output indicates the concept:
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
y.append(4)
print(x)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] - Why did x change?
# Concept: Variables as pointers
```

```python
# Error indicates the concept:
def increment():
    counter += 1  # UnboundLocalError
# Concept: Global/local scope rules
```

```python
# Comment hints at the concept:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
function(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Why did the list change?
# Concept: Pass by object reference / Mutation
```

**Strategy:**
1. Run the code and observe the actual behavior
2. Ask "Why did it do that instead of something else?"
3. The answer to that question is usually the concept
