## Problem 120: Variables vs Objects in Collections

What will be output by lines 6 and 10? Why? What concept is this demonstrating?

```python
num1 = 1
lst1 = [num1, 2, 3]

num1 += 42

print(lst1)

lst1[0] = 42

print(lst1)
```

**Follow up Question:**
- Does `lst1` contain the variable `num1`?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3]
[42, 2, 3]
```

**Explanation:**

This demonstrates **variables as pointers** and the distinction between **variables and the objects they reference**.

**Line 6 output: `[1, 2, 3]`**

When we create `lst1 = [num1, 2, 3]`, the list doesn't store the variable `num1` itself - it stores a reference to the object that `num1` points to (the integer `1`).

When we execute `num1 += 42`:
- This creates a new integer object `43`
- `num1` is reassigned to point to this new object
- The list still references the original integer `1`
- Since integers are immutable, the original `1` is unchanged

**Visualization after line 2:**
```
num1 ──> 1 <── lst1[0]
         2 <── lst1[1]
         3 <── lst1[2]
```

**After line 4 (`num1 += 42`):**
```
num1 ──> 43

         1 <── lst1[0]  (list still points to original 1)
         2 <── lst1[1]
         3 <── lst1[2]
```

**Line 10 output: `[42, 2, 3]`**

When we execute `lst1[0] = 42`:
- We're directly modifying the list
- The element at index 0 is reassigned to reference the integer `42`
- This is mutation of the list itself

**After line 8:**
```
num1 ──> 43

        42 <── lst1[0]  (list element reassigned)
         2 <── lst1[1]
         3 <── lst1[2]
```

**Follow-up Answer:**

**Does `lst1` contain the variable `num1`?**

No. `lst1` does not contain the variable `num1`. It contains a reference to the object that `num1` was pointing to when the list was created (the integer `1`).

```python
# Proof:
num1 = 1
lst1 = [num1, 2, 3]

# lst1[0] and num1 point to the same object initially
print(num1 is lst1[0])  # True (for small integers, due to caching)

num1 = 99  # Reassign num1

# But changing num1 doesn't affect lst1
print(lst1)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(num1)  # 99

# They're now different
print(num1 is lst1[0])  # False
```

**Concept:** Variables as pointers / Object references. Lists (and other collections) store references to objects, not references to variables. When you reassign a variable, it doesn't affect any collections that were created using that variable's original value.
