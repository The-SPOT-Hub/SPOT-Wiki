## Problem 89: Creating vs Accessing with `global`

Can we *create* global variables with `global` or only *access* them?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You can both create and access global variables using the `global` keyword within a function.

If the global variable doesn't exist yet, using `global` and then assigning to it will create it in the global scope.

Examples:
```python
# Creating a new global variable:
def create_global():
    global new_var  # new_var doesn't exist yet
    new_var = "I'm new!"

create_global()
print(new_var)  # I'm new! (now exists globally)
```

```python
# Modifying an existing global variable:
existing = 10

def modify_global():
    global existing  # existing already exists
    existing = 20

modify_global()
print(existing)  # 20
```

```python
# Creating multiple global variables:
def setup_globals():
    global config, settings, state
    config = {"debug": True}
    settings = {"theme": "dark"}
    state = "initialized"

setup_globals()
print(config)    # {'debug': True}
print(settings)  # {'theme': 'dark'}
print(state)     # initialized
```

**Note:** While you *can* create globals this way, it's generally not recommended as it makes code harder to understand and track.
