## Problem 12

What does this print and why, what is the concept?

```python
name = 'Abraham Lincoln'
print(f"{name} was a President of the US")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

This will print `Abraham Lincoln was a President of the US`. The `f` prefix in the `print` function allows the value of the variable to be interpolated and merged with the rest of the print statement. This demonstrates f-strings.
