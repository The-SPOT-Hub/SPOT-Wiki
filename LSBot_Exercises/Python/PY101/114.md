## Problem 114: Mutating Nested Objects

If we pass a compound data structure, like a list, into a function and we mutate an object within that list, though not the list itself, would that be considered pass-by-reference or pass-by-value behavior?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Pass-by-reference. Mutating any part of an object, even nested objects, is considered mutation.

When you mutate a nested object, you're still modifying the overall structure that was passed in, demonstrating pass-by-reference behavior.

Examples:
```python
# Mutating a nested list:
def modify_nested(lst):
    lst[0].append(999)  # Mutates the first nested list

matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
modify_nested(matrix)
print(matrix)  # [[1, 2, 999], [3, 4], [5, 6]] - mutated!
```

```python
# Mutating a dictionary within a list:
def modify_dict_in_list(lst):
    lst[0]['name'] = 'Modified'  # Mutates the dict inside the list

people = [{'name': 'Alice'}, {'name': 'Bob'}]
modify_dict_in_list(people)
print(people)  # [{'name': 'Modified'}, {'name': 'Bob'}] - mutated!
```

```python
# Deeply nested mutation:
def deep_mutation(data):
    data['users'][0]['scores'].append(100)

game_data = {
    'users': [
        {'name': 'Alice', 'scores': [85, 90]},
        {'name': 'Bob', 'scores': [75, 80]}
    ]
}

deep_mutation(game_data)
print(game_data)
# {'users': [{'name': 'Alice', 'scores': [85, 90, 100]}, ...]}
# Original structure was mutated!
```

```python
# Contrast with reassignment (pass-by-value behavior):
def reassign_nested(lst):
    lst[0] = [999]  # Reassigns the element, but still mutates lst

matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
reassign_nested(matrix)
print(matrix)  # [[999], [3, 4]] - the list itself was mutated
```

**Key insight:** Any mutation at any level of nesting is still mutation of the original structure, demonstrating pass-by-reference behavior.
