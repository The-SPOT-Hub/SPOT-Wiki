## Problem 51: Library Management System

Given a `library` object like so:

```python
library = {
    "Moby Dick": { "author": "Herman Melville", "copies": 3 },
    "1984": { "author": "George Orwell", "copies": 5 },
}
```

Write two functions, `checkout` and `checkin` that manage the books in the library. Refer to the test invocations to see the intended behavior:

```python
# Your definitions here

checkin(library, "Moby Dick")

print(library)

# Expected output:
# {
#   "Moby Dick": { "author": "Herman Melville", "copies": 4 },
#   "1984": { "author": "George Orwell", "copies": 5 }
# }

checkout(library, "1984")

print(library)

# Expected output:
# {
#   "Moby Dick": { "author": "Herman Melville", "copies": 4 },
#   "1984": { "author": "George Orwell", "copies": 4 }
# }
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Make your functions sturdier by handling the situation in which someone tries to check in or check out a title that isn't present in the library. How did you choose to handle these situations and why?

```python
def checkin(library, book):
    if book in library:
        # Increment the number of copies available
        library[book]["copies"] += 1
    else:
        print(f"'{book}' is not present in the library. Cannot check in.")

def checkout(library, book):
    if book in library:
        if library[book]["copies"] > 0:
            # Decrement the number of copies available
            library[book]["copies"] -= 1
        else:
            print(f"No copies of '{book}' are available for checkout.")
    else:
        print(f"'{book}' is not present in the library. Cannot check out.")

# Initial library object
library = {
    "Moby Dick": {"author": "Herman Melville", "copies": 3},
    "1984": {"author": "George Orwell", "copies": 5},
}

# Test invocations
checkin(library, "Moby Dick")
print(library)
# Output: {'Moby Dick': {'author': 'Herman Melville', 'copies': 4}, '1984': {'author': 'George Orwell', 'copies': 5}}

checkout(library, "1984")
print(library)
# Output: {'Moby Dick': {'author': 'Herman Melville', 'copies': 4}, '1984': {'author': 'George Orwell', 'copies': 4}}

# Bonus Challenge: Test cases for missing books
checkout(library, "The Great Gatsby")
# Output: "'The Great Gatsby' is not present in the library. Cannot check out."

checkin(library, "The Great Gatsby")
# Output: "'The Great Gatsby' is not present in the library. Cannot check in."
```

**Design Decisions:**

For missing books, I chose to print an error message and do nothing to the library. This prevents the program from crashing and provides clear feedback to the user. An alternative would be to raise an exception, which would be appropriate if we want to enforce stricter error handling.
