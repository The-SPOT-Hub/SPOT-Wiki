## Problem 91: Greeting Scope Confusion

Explain what happens when we run this code and the output we will get.

```python
greeting = 'Hello'
  
def change_greetings():
    greeting = 'Howdy'
    farewell = 'Goodbye'
    print(greeting)  # what will be output by this line?
    print(farewell)  # what will be output by this line?
  
change_greetings()
print(greeting)  # what will be output by this line?
print(farewell)  # what will be output by this line?
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. How many `greeting` variables exist in this code? How many `farewell`?
2. Is there any difference between what's happening on lines 4 & 5? How come we can access global variables within functions, but line 4 doesn't do so with `greeting`?
3. What are two distinct ways we could fix this code to get `Howdy` and `Goodbye` as our only greetings that are output?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Output:
```
Howdy
Goodbye
Hello
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 11, in <module>
    print(farewell)
NameError: name 'farewell' is not defined
```

**Explanation:**

Both `greeting` and `farewell` within `change_greetings` are local variables. The assignment `greeting = 'Howdy'` creates a new local variable instead of modifying the global one. Nothing is being changed in the global scope.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: Two `greeting` variables exist (one global, one local). One `farewell` variable exists (local only).

**Bonus 2**: No difference - both lines are **initializing** new local variables. When we use the assignment operator on a variable inside a function, Python assumes it's local unless we use `global`. Even though a global `greeting` exists, the assignment creates a new local variable that shadows it.

**Bonus 3**: 

Option 1: Using `global`:
```python
greeting = 'Hello'
  
def change_greetings():
    global greeting, farewell
    greeting = 'Howdy'
    farewell = 'Goodbye'
    print(greeting)
    print(farewell)
  
change_greetings()
print(greeting)
print(farewell)
```

Option 2: Using return values:
```python
greeting = 'Hello'
  
def change_greetings():
    greeting = 'Howdy'
    farewell = 'Goodbye'
    print(greeting)
    print(farewell)
    return greeting, farewell

greeting, farewell = change_greetings()  
print(greeting)
print(farewell)
```
