## Problem 124: Variables as Pointers with Nested Structures

What will be output by the last two lines? Explain this output. What concept is this code snippet demonstrating?

```python
default_numbers = [8, 3, 1]
person1 = { 'numbers': default_numbers }
person2 = person1

default_numbers.pop()

print(person1['numbers'])
print(person2['numbers'])
```

**Follow up questions:**
- How many dictionaries exist in this code snippet?
- How many lists?
- What if we remove `default_numbers.pop()` and replace it with `person2['numbers'].pop()`?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Output:**
```
[8, 3]
[8, 3]
```

**Explanation:**

This code demonstrates **variables as pointers** (and **mutability**).

1. `default_numbers` points to the list `[8, 3, 1]`
2. `person1` is a dictionary whose `'numbers'` key points to the same list
3. `person2` is assigned to reference the same dictionary as `person1`
4. When we call `default_numbers.pop()`, we mutate the list
5. Since both dictionaries (actually the same dictionary) point to this list, the change is visible through both `person1` and `person2`

**Visualization:**
```
default_numbers ──┐
                  ├──> [8, 3, 1]  (list object)
person1 ──┐       │
          ├──> {'numbers': ──┘
person2 ──┘       dictionary object}
```

After `pop()`:
```
default_numbers ──┐
                  ├──> [8, 3]  (mutated)
person1 ──┐       │
          ├──> {'numbers': ──┘
person2 ──┘       dictionary object}
```

**Follow-up Answers:**

**1. How many dictionaries exist?**
One dictionary. Both `person1` and `person2` point to the same dictionary object.

```python
print(person1 is person2)  # True
print(id(person1) == id(person2))  # True
```

**2. How many lists?**
One list. `default_numbers` and the value at both `person1['numbers']` and `person2['numbers']` all point to the same list object.

```python
print(default_numbers is person1['numbers'])  # True
print(person1['numbers'] is person2['numbers'])  # True
```

**3. What if we replace `default_numbers.pop()` with `person2['numbers'].pop()`?**

The output would be exactly the same: `[8, 3]` for both. We're still mutating the same list object, just accessing it through a different path.

```python
default_numbers = [8, 3, 1]
person1 = { 'numbers': default_numbers }
person2 = person1

person2['numbers'].pop()  # Same list being mutated

print(person1['numbers'])  # [8, 3]
print(person2['numbers'])  # [8, 3]
print(default_numbers)     # [8, 3] - also changed!
```
