## Problem 42: Lists Containing Variables

Can I create a list that contains variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, lists don't contain variables themselves. When you create a list with variables, the list contains references to the objects that those variables point to, not the variables themselves.

For example:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
my_list = [x, y]  # my_list contains the objects 5 and 10, not the variables x and y

x = 20  # Changing x doesn't affect my_list
print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 10]
```
