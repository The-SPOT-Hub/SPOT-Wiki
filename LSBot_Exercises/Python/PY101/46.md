## Problem 46: Reassignment and Mutation

Is reassignment ever mutating?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, reassignment is never mutating. Reassignment changes which object a variable points to, but it doesn't modify (mutate) any existing object. Mutation changes the internal state of an object, while reassignment just redirects the variable to a different object.

For example:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
x = [4, 5, 6]  # Reassignment - x now points to a different list

y = [1, 2, 3]
y.append(4)    # Mutation - the list object itself is modified
```
