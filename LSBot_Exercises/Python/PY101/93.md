## Problem 93: Creating Globals Inside Functions

What happens when we run this code? Will this throw an error?

```python
def create_global(value):
    global new_global
    new_global = value

create_global('foo')
print(new_global)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Explain precisely what happens on line 2. What happens if we comment out this line?
2. What do you think would happen if we added `print(new_global)` after `global new_global`?
3. Write a user-level description of what this code does, without worrying about the implementation details.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

This code runs without error and outputs: `foo`

**Explanation:**

In the function `create_global`, we declare a new global variable `new_global` using the `global` keyword, then assign it the passed-in value. When we call `create_global('foo')`, it creates a global variable that can be accessed from anywhere in the module, including outside the function.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: Line 2 declares that `new_global` should be treated as a global variable. This allows us to create or modify a global variable from within the function. If we comment out this line, `new_global` becomes a local variable, and line 6 (`print(new_global)`) throws a `NameError` because no global variable named `new_global` exists.

```python
def create_global(value):
    # global new_global  # Commented out
    new_global = value  # Now this is local

create_global('foo')
print(new_global)  # NameError: name 'new_global' is not defined
```

**Bonus 2**: We would get an error:

```python
def create_global(value):
    global new_global
    print(new_global)  # NameError: name 'new_global' is not defined
    new_global = value
```

The `global` statement declares that we'll be using a global variable, but it doesn't initialize it. It's similar to a declaration but not an initialization. If the global doesn't exist yet, we can't read it until after we assign to it.

**Bonus 3**: This code defines a function that can create or update a global variable with a given value. When you call the function with a value, it makes that value available globally throughout your program, and you can access it from anywhere in your code.
