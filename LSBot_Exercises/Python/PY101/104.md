## Problem 104: Nested vs Non-Nested Scoping Rules

Are the scoping rules for nested functions any different from the scoping rules for non-nested functions?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Not really. The difference is just that there's an extra layer we check before making it to the global scope.

The same LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule applies - nested functions just add the "Enclosing" layer.

Examples:
```python
# Non-nested function (LGB - no Enclosing):
x = "global"

def simple_function():
    x = "local"
    print(x)  # Checks: Local → Global → Built-in

simple_function()  # Prints: local
```

```python
# Nested function (LEGB - includes Enclosing):
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    
    def inner():
        x = "local"
        print(x)  # Checks: Local → Enclosing → Global → Built-in
    
    inner()

outer()  # Prints: local
```

```python
# When local doesn't exist, check enclosing:
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    
    def inner():
        # No local x, so checks enclosing next
        print(x)  # Finds "enclosing"
    
    inner()

outer()  # Prints: enclosing
```

```python
# Same rules apply - can read but not reassign without keywords:
def outer():
    count = 0
    
    def inner():
        print(count)  # Can read ✓
        # count += 1  # Can't modify without 'nonlocal' ✗
    
    inner()

outer()
```
