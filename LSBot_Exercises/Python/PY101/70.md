## Problem 70: Parentheses for Clarity

Assuming that parentheses aren't required, should we *use* parentheses to add clarity, or *omit* parentheses to avoid clutter?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

It's generally a good practice to use parentheses for clarity, even if they are not strictly required. This makes code easier to read and understand, reducing the risk of logical errors.

Examples:
```python
# Without parentheses (correct but potentially confusing):
if x > 5 and y < 10 or z == 0:
    print("Condition met")

# With parentheses (clearer intent):
if (x > 5 and y < 10) or (z == 0):
    print("Condition met")

# Another example:
result = a + b * c / d  # Works, but precedence isn't obvious

result = a + ((b * c) / d)  # Clearer, even if redundant
```

While you should know operator precedence, using parentheses helps other developers (and your future self) understand your code more quickly.
