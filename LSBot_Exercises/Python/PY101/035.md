## Problem 35: Rainbow List Modification

I messed up my rainbow list. How can I replace `None` with the proper next color, 'green'? Try to come up with three distinct ways to fix the rainbow.

```python
next_color = 'green'
rainbow = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', None]

# ???

print(rainbow) # => ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green']
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What if we didn't know how long the list was? Which of your solutions would still work, if any?
2. Did any of your solutions *mutate* the list? Which ones?
3. Could you use `==` to check your `rainbow` against the expected result? Why or why not?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Can be done in many ways.

```python
rainbow[rainbow.index(None)] = next_color

rainbow = [next_color if color is None else color for color in rainbow]

rainbow[-1] = next_color

rainbow.pop()
rainbow.append(next_color)
```

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: The first two solutions would still work if we didn't know the list length.

**Bonus 2**: Yes, the first, third, and fourth solutions mutate the list. The second solution creates a new list.

**Bonus 3**: Yes, you can use `==` to check if `rainbow` matches the expected result. The `==` operator compares the contents of lists element by element. As long as the contents and order are the same, the comparison will return `True`.
