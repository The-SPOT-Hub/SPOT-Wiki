## Problem 52: Is Every Value Truthy or Falsy?

Is *every* value either truthy or falsy?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, every **value** in Python is truthy or falsy.

Every value in Python can be evaluated in a boolean context (like in an `if` statement), and it will be considered either truthy or falsy. There is no value that doesn't have truthiness.

For example:
```python
if 42:  # 42 is truthy
    print("This runs")

if "":  # "" is falsy
    print("This doesn't run")
```
