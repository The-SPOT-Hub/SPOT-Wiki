## Problem 99: Should We Use Variable Shadowing?

Is variable shadowing a tool we can use, or something we need to be aware of to avoid?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Generally to be avoided. Variable shadowing can make code confusing and harder to debug because it's not immediately clear which variable you're referring to.

**Problems with shadowing:**
- Makes code harder to read and understand
- Can lead to subtle bugs
- Makes it difficult to access the shadowed variable
- Can confuse other developers (and your future self)

Examples:
```python
# Confusing code with shadowing:
total = 100

def calculate(total):  # Shadows global total
    total = total * 2  # Which total is which?
    return total

result = calculate(5)
print(result)  # 10
print(total)   # 100 - but this isn't obvious
```

```python
# Better: Use different names:
total = 100

def calculate(amount):  # Clear, distinct name
    doubled = amount * 2
    return doubled

result = calculate(5)
print(result)  # 10
print(total)   # 100 - clear what this refers to
```
