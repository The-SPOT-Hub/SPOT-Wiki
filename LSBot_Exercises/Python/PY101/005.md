# PY101
## Problem 5

What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def division(number1, number2):
    numerator = number1
    denominator = number2

    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "The denominator cannot be zero"
print(division(5, 0))
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `division` function takes two integer arguments and attempts to divide the first by the second within a `try/except` block to catch a `ZeroDivisionError`. When called with the arguments `5` and `0`, the attempt to divide by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is handled by the `except` block. The function then returns the string `"The denominator cannot be zero"`, which is what is printed.

Concepts covered: `try/except` blocks and `ZeroDivisionErrors`.
