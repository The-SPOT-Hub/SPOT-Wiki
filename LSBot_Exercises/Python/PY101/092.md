## Problem 92: Loop Variable Scope

What happens when we run this code? Why?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
number_enthusiast = 'Lisa Simpson'

for num in numbers:
    sentence = number_enthusiast + f" loves the number {num}!"
    print(sentence)

print(num)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What precisely explains why we get the output we do from line 8?
2. How many scopes are there in this snippet, and what variables are available in each?
3. What global variables are there and what local variables are there in this code?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

Output:
```
Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
Lisa Simpson loves the number 2!
Lisa Simpson loves the number 3!
3
```

**Explanation:**

There is one scope: the global scope. Printing `num` prints `3` because that's the last value `num` took on in the `for` loop. 

**Important:** `for` loops (and `while` loops, `if` statements, etc.) do not create inner scopes in Python. All variables created in these constructs exist in the same scope as the construct itself.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: The `for` loop doesn't create a new scope. The variable `num` exists in the same scope as the rest of the code (global scope in this case). After the loop finishes, `num` still exists and holds the last value it was assigned (3).

**Bonus 2**: There is only one scope - the global/module scope. All variables are available everywhere in this code: `numbers`, `number_enthusiast`, `num`, and `sentence`.

**Bonus 3**: All variables are global: `numbers`, `number_enthusiast`, `num`, and `sentence`. There are no local variables because there are no functions.

Contrast with languages like JavaScript where block scope exists:
```python
# Python - loop variable persists:
for i in range(3):
    pass
print(i)  # 2 - works fine

# In languages with block scope, this would error
```
