## Problem 105: Parameter Shadowing Example

Is this an example of variable shadowing? Why or why not?

```python
favorite_number = 42

def shadow_it(favorite_number):
    print(f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}!")

shadow_it(8)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What would happen if we got rid of the parameter `favorite_number`? Would we be able to print out 42?
2. What could we do if we wanted to have access to *both* numbers, `42` and `8`? Is `global` necessary to make this possible?
3. What happens if we put the line `global favorite_number` in our function before our call to print?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, this is an example of variable shadowing. The parameter `favorite_number` shadows the global variable `favorite_number`.

Output: `My favorite number is 8!`

The function parameter creates a local variable that shadows the global variable with the same name. Inside the function, `favorite_number` refers to the parameter (8), not the global variable (42).

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: We would initially get a `TypeError` due to an incorrect number of arguments:

```python
favorite_number = 42

def shadow_it(favorite_number):  # Still expects an argument
    print(f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}!")

# shadow_it()  # TypeError: shadow_it() missing 1 required positional argument
```

If we removed the parameter as well:
```python
favorite_number = 42

def shadow_it():  # No parameter
    print(f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}!")

shadow_it()  # My favorite number is 42!
```

We would successfully print out 42, having eliminated variable shadowing.

**Bonus 2**: We would need to rename one of them. Either the global variable name or the parameter. No, we don't need `global` for this solution:

```python
global_favorite = 42

def shadow_it(favorite_number):
    print(f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}!")
    print(f"The global favorite is {global_favorite}!")

shadow_it(8)
# My favorite number is 8!
# The global favorite is 42!
```

Or:
```python
favorite_number = 42

def shadow_it(user_favorite):
    print(f"My favorite number is {user_favorite}!")
    print(f"The default favorite is {favorite_number}!")

shadow_it(8)
```

**Bonus 3**: We get a `SyntaxError`:

```python
favorite_number = 42

def shadow_it(favorite_number):
    global favorite_number  # SyntaxError: name 'favorite_number' is parameter and global
    print(f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}!")
```

Trying to declare a global variable with the same name as a parameter must be a mistake, so Python doesn't allow it.
