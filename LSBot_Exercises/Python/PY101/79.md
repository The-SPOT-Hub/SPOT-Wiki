## Problem 79: Normalize User Info with Short-Circuiting

Write a function that, given user info that may be `None`, populates any missing info using short-circuiting logic.

```python
def normalize(name, age, email):
    pass


print(normalize('Marcy', None, None))
# {"name": "Marcy", "age": "Unknown", "email": "Unknown"}
print(normalize(None, None, 'best.user@gmail.com'))
# {"name": "Jane Doe", "age": "Unknown", "email": "best.user@gmail.com"}
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

What happens if we pass in an empty string as the `name` or `email`? How might we improve our function to replace these with the defaults? What if we pass in a negative number for the `age`? Can you make these improvements while still using short-circuiting?

```python
def normalize(name, age, email):
    return {
        "name": name or "Jane Doe",
        "age": age or "Unknown",
        "email": email or "Unknown"
    }

print(normalize('Marcy', None, None))
# {"name": "Marcy", "age": "Unknown", "email": "Unknown"}
print(normalize(None, None, 'best.user@gmail.com'))
# {"name": "Jane Doe", "age": "Unknown", "email": "best.user@gmail.com"}
```

**Bonus Challenge Answer:**

The problem with the simple solution is that empty strings (`""`) and `0` are falsy, so they'll be replaced with defaults even if they were intentionally provided.

Improved version handling edge cases:
```python
def normalize(name, age, email):
    # Handle empty strings and None for name/email
    # Handle None and negative numbers for age
    normalized_name = name if name else "Jane Doe"
    normalized_email = email if email else "Unknown"
    
    # For age, check if it's None or negative
    if age is None or (isinstance(age, (int, float)) and age < 0):
        normalized_age = "Unknown"
    else:
        normalized_age = age
    
    return {
        "name": normalized_name,
        "age": normalized_age,
        "email": normalized_email
    }

# Test cases:
print(normalize('Marcy', None, None))
# {"name": "Marcy", "age": "Unknown", "email": "Unknown"}

print(normalize('', -5, ''))
# {"name": "Jane Doe", "age": "Unknown", "email": "Unknown"}

print(normalize('John', 0, 'john@email.com'))
# {"name": "John", "age": 0, "email": "john@email.com"}
```

More compact version using short-circuiting:
```python
def normalize(name, age, email):
    return {
        "name": name or "Jane Doe",
        "age": age if (age is not None and age >= 0) else "Unknown",
        "email": email or "Unknown"
    }
```
