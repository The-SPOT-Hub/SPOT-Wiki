## Problem 76: Function Calls and Short-Circuiting

What will be the output of the following code? Why?

```python
def foo():
    phrase = "foo was called"
    print(phrase)
    return phrase

def bar():
    phrase = "bar was called"
    print(phrase)

result = foo() and bar()
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What does `result` reference at the end of this snippet?
2. What happens if we change both methods to return `phrase` instead of just `foo`?
3. What could we do if we wanted `result` to reference a *boolean* to indicate whether both functions have truthy return values?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output will be:
```
foo was called
bar was called
```

**Explanation:**

The `foo` function is called first, printing "foo was called" and returning the string "foo was called", which is a truthy value. Because of short-circuiting, since the first operand is truthy, `bar` is then called, printing "bar was called". However, `bar` returns `None` (implicit return), so `result` will reference `None`.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: `result` references `None` because `bar` implicitly returns `None`, and `and` returns the second operand when the first is truthy.

**Bonus 2**: If we change both methods to return `phrase`, `result` will reference "bar was called", the return value of `bar`, since both functions will return truthy values and `and` returns the second operand.

```python
def bar():
    phrase = "bar was called"
    print(phrase)
    return phrase  # Now returns a value

result = foo() and bar()  # result will be "bar was called"
```

**Bonus 3**: We could use `bool()` to convert the result:

```python
result = bool(foo() and bar())
# Or more explicitly:
result = bool(foo()) and bool(bar())
```
