## Problem 85: Global vs Local Variables

What makes a variable *global* instead of *local*?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Global indicates a variable that's defined at the top level, or outside of all functions. It's accessible throughout the entire script.

A variable is global if it's defined in the module's main body (not inside any function, class, or other structure). Local variables are defined inside functions.

Examples:
```python
# Global variables (defined at module level):
global_var = "I'm global"
counter = 0

def my_function():
    # Local variable (defined inside function):
    local_var = "I'm local"
    
    print(global_var)  # Can access global
    print(local_var)   # Can access local

my_function()
print(global_var)  # Can access global from outside
# print(local_var)  # NameError - local_var doesn't exist here
```

```python
# These are all global:
name = "Alice"
age = 30
scores = [85, 90, 95]

def display_info():
    # This is local:
    message = f"{name} is {age}"
    return message
```
