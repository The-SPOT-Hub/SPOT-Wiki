## Problem 100: Variable Lookup Order

Where does Python look to find local variables *first* when we reference them?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Within the local scope of the current function.

Python uses the LEGB rule to look up variables:
1. **L**ocal - the current function's scope
2. **E**nclosing - any enclosing function's scope
3. **G**lobal - the module's global scope
4. **B**uilt-in - Python's built-in names

Examples:
```python
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    
    def inner():
        x = "local"  # Python finds this first
        print(x)
    
    inner()  # Prints: local

outer()
```

```python
# Demonstrating LEGB:
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    
    def middle():
        # No x here, so Python looks in enclosing
        def inner():
            print(x)  # Finds "enclosing" in outer()
        
        inner()
    
    middle()

outer()  # Prints: enclosing
```

```python
# When variable is not in local scope:
global_var = 100

def my_function():
    local_var = 10
    print(local_var)    # Found in local scope
    print(global_var)   # Not in local, found in global scope

my_function()
```
