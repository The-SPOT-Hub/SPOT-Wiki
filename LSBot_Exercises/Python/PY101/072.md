## Problem 72: Relying on Short-Circuiting

Should short-circuiting ever be relied upon, or is it something we must know about to avoid mistakes?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Short-circuiting can be relied upon for certain scenarios, such as when checking conditions before accessing an attribute or calling a function that might otherwise cause an exception. However, it should be used carefully and deliberately to ensure that the code remains readable and understandable.

Examples of good use:
```python
# Avoiding AttributeError:
if user and user.email:  # Checks user exists before accessing email
    send_email(user.email)

# Avoiding division by zero:
if denominator != 0 and numerator / denominator > 10:
    print("Ratio is high")

# Default values:
name = user_name or "Guest"  # Use "Guest" if user_name is falsy
```

Examples of potentially confusing use:
```python
# This works but might be unclear:
result = condition and expensive_function() or default_value

# This is clearer:
if condition and expensive_function():
    result = expensive_function()  # Note: now called twice!
else:
    result = default_value

# Or better yet:
result = expensive_function() if condition else default_value
```
