## Problem 34: Truthiness and Flow Control

What will be output by this code and why?

```python
value1 = (3 < 2)
value2 = (6 % 2 == 0)
value3 = ('Python' == 'python')
  
if value1:
    print("It must be value1")
elif value2 and value3:
    print("It must be value2 and value3")
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Do `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` reference expressions?
2. Would it ever be possible for both of these calls to `print` to be executed?
3. Are there any return values in this code? If so, what are they?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `if` and `elif` branches both evaluate to `False`, so nothing is output.

**Bonus 1**: `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` don't reference expressions but rather reference the value that these expressions evaluate to. When we initialize them, we evaluate the expression.

**Bonus 2**: No, `if-elif` structures may only execute a single block.

**Bonus 3**: This code doesn't necessarily 'return' anything. We are invoking `print`, which has a return value of `None`, but the code as a whole doesn't 'return' anything.
