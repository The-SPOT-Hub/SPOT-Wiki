## Problem 81: What is a Local Variable?

What is a local variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A variable defined within a function, accessible only in that function.

Local variables are created when a function is called and destroyed when the function returns. They exist only within the function's scope.

Examples:
```python
def my_function():
    local_var = 10  # This is a local variable
    print(local_var)

my_function()  # Prints: 10
print(local_var)  # NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined
```

```python
def calculate():
    result = 5 + 3  # 'result' is local to calculate()
    return result

answer = calculate()  # We get the value via return
print(answer)  # 8
# print(result)  # Would raise NameError
```
