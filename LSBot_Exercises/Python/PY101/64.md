## Problem 64: Say Hi Function

What is the output when we run this code? Walk through what happens.

```python
def say_hi():
    print('Hello!')
  
greeting = say_hi()
word = ''
  
if greeting:
    word = 'Something'
elif greeting == False:
    word = 'Something else'
else:
    word = greeting
  
if word: print("Wow")
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Do we invoke `say_hi` every time we reference `greeting`? Why or why not?
2. What happens if we `return` our call to `print` within `say_hi`?
3. Is the `say_hi` function truthy? Why or why not?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output is: `Hello!` (and nothing else)

**Explanation:**

The key is that `say_hi` returns `None` and therefore `greeting` references `None`, a falsy value. Because `greeting` references `None`, which is falsy *and* not equal to `False`, the `else` branch runs and assigns `word` to `None`. Since `word` references a falsy value, "Wow" is not printed.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: No. `greeting` references the return value of `say_hi`. We invoke the function once when we assign `greeting = say_hi()`.

**Bonus 2**: Nothing changes. The function already has an implicit return value of `None`. `print` returns `None` as well, so `return print('Hello!')` still returns `None`.

**Bonus 3**: Functions don't have truthiness. The `say_hi` function, when invoked, **returns** a falsy value.
