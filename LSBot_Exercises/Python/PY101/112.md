## Problem 112: Mutable Objects and Pass-by-Reference

Do functions that take mutable objects as arguments always exhibit pass-by-reference behavior? Why?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Not always. We can pass a mutable object and still decide not to mutate it.

Just because an object *can* be mutated doesn't mean it *will* be mutated. The behavior depends on what the function does with the parameter.

Examples:
```python
# Pass-by-value-like behavior (no mutation):
def read_list(lst):
    total = sum(lst)  # Only reads, doesn't mutate
    return total

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = read_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3] - unchanged
```

```python
# Pass-by-reference-like behavior (mutates):
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)  # Mutates the list

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] - changed!
```

```python
# Reassignment looks like pass-by-value:
def reassign_list(lst):
    lst = [99, 99]  # Creates new list, doesn't mutate original

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
reassign_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3] - unchanged
```

```python
# Can even return a new list without mutating:
def get_doubled(lst):
    return [x * 2 for x in lst]  # Creates new list

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = get_doubled(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3] - original unchanged
print(new_list) # [2, 4, 6] - new list
```

**The key point:** Pass-by-reference behavior only occurs when a function *actually mutates* a mutable object. The mere fact that an object is mutable doesn't guarantee mutation will occur.
