## Problem 68: Same Precedence Evaluation

How are operations evaluated when there are two operators **of the same precedence**?

Left to right, unless it's exponentiation.

Most operators are left-associative, meaning they're evaluated from left to right when they have the same precedence. However, exponentiation (`**`) is right-associative.

Examples:
```python
# Left-to-right evaluation (left-associative):
result = 10 - 5 - 2  # Evaluated as (10 - 5) - 2 = 3, not 10 - (5 - 2) = 7
result = 20 / 4 / 2  # Evaluated as (20 / 4) / 2 = 2.5, not 20 / (4 / 2) = 10.0

# Right-to-left evaluation (right-associative):
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Evaluated as 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 2 ** 9 = 512
                       # Not (2 ** 3) ** 2 = 8 ** 2 = 64
```
