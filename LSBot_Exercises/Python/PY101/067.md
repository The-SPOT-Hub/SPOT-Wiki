## Problem 67: Unary, Binary, and Ternary Operators

What's the difference between a **unary**, **binary**, and a **ternary** operator?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- A **unary** operator has only one operand (e.g., `not`, `-` for negation)
- A **binary** operator has two operands (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- A **ternary** operator has three operands (e.g., `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`)

Examples:
```python
# Unary operators:
not True        # 'not' operates on one operand
-5              # Negation operates on one operand
+5              # Unary plus

# Binary operators:
5 + 3           # '+' operates on two operands
10 - 2          # '-' operates on two operands
x and y         # 'and' operates on two operands

# Ternary operator (conditional expression):
x if x > 0 else -x  # Three operands: x, x > 0, -x
```
