## Problem 102: Nesting Depth and Global Access

How many functions deep can we go before we can't access variables from the global scope?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

No limit. You can nest functions as deeply as you want and still access global variables.

Examples:
```python
global_var = "I'm global!"

def level_1():
    def level_2():
        def level_3():
            def level_4():
                def level_5():
                    print(global_var)  # Can still access global
                
                level_5()
            
            level_4()
        
        level_3()
    
    level_2()

level_1()  # Prints: I'm global!
```

```python
# Works at any depth:
x = 100

def a():
    def b():
        def c():
            def d():
                def e():
                    def f():
                        print(x)  # Still accessible
                    f()
                e()
            d()
        c()
    b()

a()  # Prints: 100
```

```python
# Each level can also have its own variables:
global_var = "global"

def outer():
    outer_var = "outer"
    
    def middle():
        middle_var = "middle"
        
        def inner():
            inner_var = "inner"
            # Can access all of them:
            print(global_var, outer_var, middle_var, inner_var)
        
        inner()
    
    middle()

outer()  # Prints: global outer middle inner
```
