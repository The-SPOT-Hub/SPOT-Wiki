## Problem 101: Can We Nest Functions?

Can we nest functions within other functions in Python?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes. Python allows you to define functions inside other functions. These are called nested functions or inner functions.

Examples:
```python
def outer():
    print("Outer function")
    
    def inner():
        print("Inner function")
    
    inner()  # Call the inner function

outer()
# Output:
# Outer function
# Inner function
```

```python
# Nested functions can access outer function's variables:
def outer():
    message = "Hello from outer"
    
    def inner():
        print(message)  # Can access outer's variable
    
    inner()

outer()  # Prints: Hello from outer
```

```python
# Practical use - closures:
def make_multiplier(factor):
    def multiply(number):
        return number * factor
    
    return multiply

times_three = make_multiplier(3)
print(times_three(5))  # 15
print(times_three(10)) # 30
```
