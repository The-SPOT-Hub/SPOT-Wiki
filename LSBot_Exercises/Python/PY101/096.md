## Problem 96: What is Variable Shadowing?

At a high level, what does it mean for a variable to be shadowed?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

When two variables with the same name are both accessible in a scope, the variable in the inner scope shadows the one in the outer scope.

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, effectively hiding the outer variable from the inner scope.

Examples:
```python
x = 10  # Outer scope

def my_function():
    x = 20  # Inner scope - shadows the outer x
    print(x)  # Prints 20, not 10

my_function()
print(x)  # Prints 10 - outer x is unchanged
```

```python
name = "Global"

def greet(name):  # Parameter shadows global variable
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Local")  # Hello, Local!
print(name)     # Global
```
