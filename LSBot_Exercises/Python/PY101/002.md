## Problem 2

What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b)
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The value of the two integers added together is the integer `3`. The `print` function coerces the `3` into a string, the `print()` function always coerces any argument into strings. However, it is not considered to be coercion, because it happens behind the scenes. It doesn't return the resulting strings, it just prints them.
