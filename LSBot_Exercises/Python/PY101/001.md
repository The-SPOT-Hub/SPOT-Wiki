# PY101
## Problem 1

Which variable is coerced? Is it implicit or explicit coercion?

```python
x = 3.5
y = 5
z = x + y
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The variable `x` is assigned to the float `3.5`, the variable `y` is assigned to the integer `5`. The variable `z` is assigned to the evaluated result of `x + y`. When `x` and `y` are added, `y` is implicitly coerced to a float as Python can not add different variable types. This is an example of implicit coercion.
