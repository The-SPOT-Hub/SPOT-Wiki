## Problem 41: Variables Referencing Variables

Can variables reference other variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, variables cannot reference other variables directly. Variables are names that point to objects in memory. When you assign one variable to another, you're making both variables point to the same object, not making one variable point to the other variable.

For example:
```python
a = 5
b = a  # b points to the same object (5) that a points to, not to variable a itself
a = 10  # a now points to a different object, but b still points to 5
```
