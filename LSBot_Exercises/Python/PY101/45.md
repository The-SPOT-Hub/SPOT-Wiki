## Problem 45: Working with Immutable Types

If we can't mutate some data types, like integers, then how can we use them? We can't type out all of the numbers we need, so how do we work with immutable data types?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

We work with immutable data types through reassignment and operations that create new objects. When you perform operations on immutable types, Python creates new objects rather than modifying the existing ones.

For example:
```python
x = 5
x = x + 3  # Creates a new integer object (8) and reassigns x to point to it

name = "Alice"
name = name.upper()  # Creates a new string "ALICE" and reassigns name to it
```

This works perfectly fine because variables can be reassigned to point to new objects. The immutability just means the original object doesn't changeâ€”we create new objects instead.
