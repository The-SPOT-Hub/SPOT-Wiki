## Problem 71: Short-Circuiting Operators

What operators can lead to short-circuiting?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `and` and `or` logical operators can lead to short-circuiting.

- For `and`, if the first operand is falsy, the second operand is not evaluated.
- For `or`, if the first operand is truthy, the second operand is not evaluated.

Examples:
```python
# Short-circuiting with 'and':
result = False and print("This won't print")  # print is never called

# Short-circuiting with 'or':
result = True or print("This won't print")    # print is never called

# When short-circuit doesn't happen:
result = True and print("This WILL print")    # print is called
result = False or print("This WILL print")    # print is called

# Practical use case:
if user and user.is_active():  # Prevents error if user is None
    print("User is active")
```
