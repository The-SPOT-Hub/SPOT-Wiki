## Problem 86: Global vs Local - Which to Prefer?

Should we prefer global variables or local variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

We should limit scope as much as possible, meaning that local variables are preferred over global.

**Reasons to prefer local variables:**
- Easier to understand and debug
- Reduces unintended side effects
- Makes functions more reusable and testable
- Prevents naming conflicts
- Makes code more modular

Examples:
```python
# Bad: Using global variables
total = 0

def add_to_total(value):
    global total
    total += value

def reset_total():
    global total
    total = 0

# Good: Using local variables and return values
def calculate_total(values):
    total = 0
    for value in values:
        total += value
    return total

result = calculate_total([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Global variables are acceptable for:
- Configuration constants (usually in UPPER_CASE)
- True application-wide state that needs to be shared

```python
# Acceptable use of globals for constants:
MAX_RETRIES = 3
API_URL = "https://api.example.com"

def fetch_data():
    # Using the constant is fine
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
        # ... fetch logic
        pass
```
