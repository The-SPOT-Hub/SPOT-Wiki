## Problem 110: Python's Argument Passing Model

Does Python use Pass-by-Reference, Pass-by-Value, both, or something else?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Python uses **pass by object reference** (also called "pass by assignment" or "pass by sharing").

This is different from both pure pass-by-value and pure pass-by-reference:
- If it were **pass-by-value**, we wouldn't be able to mutate objects through function parameters
- If it were **pass-by-reference**, reassignment would change the reference outside of the function as well

**How it works:**
When you pass an object to a function, you're passing a reference to the object, not a copy of the object or a reference to the variable itself.

Examples:
```python
# Can mutate mutable objects (not pure pass-by-value):
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] - the list was modified!
```

```python
# But reassignment doesn't affect the outside variable (not pure pass-by-reference):
def reassign_list(lst):
    lst = [99, 99, 99]  # This creates a new list

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
reassign_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3] - unchanged!
```

```python
# Both parameter and variable point to the same object initially:
def show_same_object(lst):
    print(id(lst))

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(my_list))
show_same_object(my_list)  # Same id!
```
