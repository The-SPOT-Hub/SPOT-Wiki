## Problem 60: Variables and Collections as Expressions

Is a variable an expression? How about a collection?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes. Yes. A collection can be represented either as a literal, by a variable, or created via an expression. All are expressions.

Variables evaluate to the value they reference, and collections evaluate to themselves. Both can be used anywhere an expression is expected.

Examples:
```python
x = 5
y = [1, 2, 3]

# Variables are expressions:
if x:              # x evaluates to 5
    print(x + 1)   # x + 1 is an expression

# Collections are expressions:
if [1, 2, 3]:           # List literal is an expression (truthy!)
    print("Truthy")

if y:                   # Variable referencing collection is an expression
    print(len(y))       # y evaluates to the list [1, 2, 3]

# Collection created via expression:
if [i for i in range(3)]:  # List comprehension is an expression
    print("Also truthy")
```
