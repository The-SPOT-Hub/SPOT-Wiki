## Problem 39: What is Reassignment?

What does it mean to **reassign** a variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

To reassign a variable means to change what object the variable points to. When you reassign a variable, you're making it reference a different value or object in memory.

For example:
```python
x = 5      # x points to the integer 5
x = 10     # x is reassigned to point to the integer 10
```
