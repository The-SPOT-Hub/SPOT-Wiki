## Problem 65: Chocolate Bar Shop Logic

Your friend shows you this code they've written to open up a chocolate bar shop. How can you demonstrate to them the logical flaw with this setup? Can you propose an alternative?

```python
my_cash = 0

if my_cash:
    print("One chocolate bar, please!")
else:
    print("I don't have 3 dollars to spend. :(")
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Turn this into a function, `buy_chocolate_bar(cash)`.
2. Once you have a function, try to subtract the 3 dollars from the customer's cash. Do you run into any issues? Why?
3. Can you add an inventory that checks to make sure there are chocolate bars left before selling them?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**The Flaw:**

Any truthy value will allow a person to buy a chocolate bar. We can demonstrate with `-10` or even `1` dollarâ€”both would allow the purchase despite not having enough money.

**Alternative:**

```python
my_cash = 0

if my_cash >= 3:
    print("One chocolate bar, please!")
else:
    print("I don't have 3 dollars to spend. :(")
```

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**:
```python
def buy_chocolate_bar(cash):
    if cash >= 3:
        print("One chocolate bar, please!")
        return cash - 3
    else:
        print("I don't have 3 dollars to spend. :(")
        return cash
```

**Bonus 2**: This doesn't work as expected if we try to mutate `cash` from within a function because integers are immutable. We can't alter the value of an integer `cash` argument from within a function. We need to return the new value and reassign it.

**Bonus 3**:
```python
inventory = 10

def buy_chocolate_bar(cash):
    global inventory
    
    if inventory <= 0:
        print("Sorry, we're out of chocolate bars!")
        return cash
    elif cash >= 3:
        print("One chocolate bar, please!")
        inventory -= 1
        return cash - 3
    else:
        print("I don't have 3 dollars to spend. :(")
        return cash
```
