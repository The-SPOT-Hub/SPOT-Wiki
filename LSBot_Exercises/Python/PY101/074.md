## Problem 74: Operators or Flow Control?

Are `and` and `or` operators or flow control?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

`and` and `or` are logical operators. However, they can act similarly to flow control because they determine whether the second operand is evaluated based on the result of the first operand.

They're operators that have flow control characteristics due to short-circuiting.

Examples:
```python
# Acting as operators:
result = True and False  # Evaluates to False
result = True or False   # Evaluates to True

# Acting like flow control (short-circuiting):
True or expensive_function()   # expensive_function() never runs
False and expensive_function() # expensive_function() never runs

# This demonstrates the flow control aspect:
def side_effect():
    print("Function called!")
    return True

result = False and side_effect()  # "Function called!" never prints
result = True or side_effect()    # "Function called!" never prints
```

Unlike `if` statements (which are pure flow control), `and` and `or` are expressions that return values while also controlling execution flow through short-circuiting.
