## Problem 40: Multiple Variables, Same Object

Is it possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, it is possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object. When you assign one variable to another, both variables reference the same object in memory.

For example:
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1  # Both list1 and list2 now point to the same list object
```
