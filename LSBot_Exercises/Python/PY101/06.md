# PY101
## Problem 6

What does this print and why, what concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def addition(number1, number2):
    number1 += number2
x = 1
y = 2
addition(x, y)
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

This code prints `x is 1, y is 2`. The `addition` function takes two integer arguments. When `x` and `y` are passed to the function, `number1` and `number2` are local variables that hold copies of the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. When `number1 += number2` is executed, a new integer object is created and bound to the variable `number1` within the function's scope. This does not change the original variable `x` outside of the function.

Concept covered: The immutability of integers in Python. When you perform an operation on an immutable object, you are creating a new object rather than modifying the original one in place.
