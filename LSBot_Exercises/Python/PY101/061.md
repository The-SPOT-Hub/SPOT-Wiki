## Problem 61: Expressions in Conditionals

Can I use any expression in an `if` conditional or only some?

Yes, you can use any expression in an `if` conditional. Python will evaluate the expression and check its truthiness.

The expression doesn't have to be a boolean. It can be any expression that evaluates to a value. Python will then check if that value is truthy or falsy.

Examples:
```python
# Comparison expression (evaluates to bool):
if x > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")

# Arithmetic expression (evaluates to number):
if x + 10:  # Truthy if result is non-zero
    print("Sum is non-zero")

# String expression:
if "hello".upper():  # Evaluates to "HELLO", which is truthy
    print("Truthy string")

# Function call expression:
if len([]):  # Evaluates to 0, which is falsy
    print("Won't print")

# Variable expression:
if my_list:  # Evaluates to whatever my_list references
    print("my_list is truthy")
```
