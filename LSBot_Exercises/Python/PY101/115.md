## Problem 115: String Capitalization Function

We tried to write a function that capitalizes the strings in a sentence and adds an exclamation point. Why didn't it work?

```python
def exclaim(lst):
    for sentence in lst:
        sentence.capitalize()
        sentence += '!'

    print(lst)  # what will this output?

actions = ['twist it', 'spin it', 'bop it']
exclaim(actions)
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Lists are mutable, but this code still doesn't work. How could we capitalize on the mutability of lists to make this code work?
2. How could we make a similar function with 'pass-by-value' behavior?
3. Does it matter if we choose 'pass-by-value' or 'pass-by-reference' behavior for this problem? How can we decide?

Output: `['twist it', 'spin it', 'bop it']` (unchanged)

**Why it doesn't work:**

Strings are immutable. Both `.capitalize()` and `+=` create new string objects rather than modifying the existing strings. The new strings are never saved back to the list.

```python
# What's happening:
def exclaim(lst):
    for sentence in lst:
        sentence.capitalize()  # Returns NEW string, but we don't save it
        sentence += '!'        # Creates NEW string, but we don't save it
        # sentence is now a local variable pointing to a new string
        # The original strings in the list are unchanged
```

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: Save the new string and reassign each index of the list:

```python
def exclaim(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        lst[i] = lst[i].capitalize() + '!'  # Reassign the list element
    print(lst)

actions = ['twist it', 'spin it', 'bop it']
exclaim(actions)
# ['Twist it!', 'Spin it!', 'Bop it!']
```

Or using enumerate:
```python
def exclaim(lst):
    for i, sentence in enumerate(lst):
        lst[i] = sentence.capitalize() + '!'
    print(lst)
```

**Bonus 2**: Create a new list with new strings, leaving the original intact:

```python
def exclaim(lst):
    return [sentence.capitalize() + '!' for sentence in lst]

actions = ['twist it', 'spin it', 'bop it']
result = exclaim(actions)
print(result)   # ['Twist it!', 'Spin it!', 'Bop it!']
print(actions)  # ['twist it', 'spin it', 'bop it'] - original unchanged
```

**Bonus 3**: It depends on the use case. Some considerations:

**Choose pass-by-reference (mutation) when:**
- You want to save memory (no new list created)
- The caller expects the original list to be modified
- You're processing data in place

**Choose pass-by-value (new list) when:**
- You need to preserve the original data
- Multiple parts of your program use the same data
- You want clearer, more predictable code (fewer side effects)

```python
# Example where you might want pass-by-reference:
huge_list = ['string' + str(i) for i in range(1000000)]
normalize_in_place(huge_list)  # Don't create a copy!

# Example where you might want pass-by-value:
original_data = ['twist it', 'spin it', 'bop it']
display_version = exclaim(original_data)  # Keep original for other uses
```
