## Problem 19

What do these print and why?

```python
print("Hello World".isalnum())
print("Hello@World".isalnum())
print("".isalnum())
print("Hello123".isalnum())
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The output will be:
```
False
False
False
True
```

The `.isalnum()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (letters or numbers) and there is at least one character. It returns `False` for the first string because of the space, `False` for the second because of the `@` symbol, and `False` for the third because it is empty. It returns `True` for the last string because it contains only letters and numbers.
