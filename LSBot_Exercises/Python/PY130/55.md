## Problem 55: Earliest Character

Using the `reduce` function, find the character that appears earliest in alphabetical order from the list `colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']`. Your lambda should compare the first letter of each color to the accumulator. Start with an initial accumulator value of `'z'`. You may use `functools.reduce` or the custom `reduce` function from PY130.

With custom `reduce`:

```python
def reduce(callback, iterable, start):
    accum = start
    for item in iterable:
        accum = callback(item, accum)
    return accum

colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']
earliest_char = reduce(
    lambda color, accum: color[0] if color[0] < accum else accum,
    colors,
    'z'
)
print(earliest_char)  # 'b' (from 'blue')
```

With `functools.reduce`:

```python
from functools import reduce

colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']
earliest_char = reduce(
    lambda accum, color: color[0] if color[0] < accum else accum,
    colors,
    'z'
)
print(earliest_char)  # 'b' (from 'blue')
```
