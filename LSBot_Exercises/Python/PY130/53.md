## Problem 53: Summing with Reduce 

Given `numbers = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)`, use `reduce` and a lambda to compute the sum of all numbers, starting with an accumulator value of 0. You may use `functools.reduce` or the custom `reduce` function from PY130.

With custom `reduce`:

```python
def reduce(callback, iterable, start):
    accum = start
    for item in iterable:
        accum = callback(item, accum)
    return accum

numbers = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
total = reduce(lambda num, accum: num + accum, numbers, 0)
print(total) # 31
```

With `functools.reduce`:

```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
total = reduce(lambda accum, num: accum + num, numbers, 0)
print(total) # 31
```
