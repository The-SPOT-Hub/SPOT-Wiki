## Problem 7: Keyword Arguments Bug Fix

The `find_person` function below is designed to accept any number of keyword arguments and check if a person named "Ayu" is present. The current implementation has a bug that causes a `KeyError` if certain keyword arguments are passed. Identify the bug, explain the problem, and provide a fix.

```python
def find_person(**kwargs):
    if "Ayu" in kwargs:
        print(f"Ayu's profession is {kwargs['Ayu']}")
    elif kwargs['Ginni']:
         print("Ayu not found, but Ginni is present.")
    else:
        print("Ayu not found.")

# This call works fine
find_person(John="Engineer", Ayu="Software Engineer")

# This call raises a KeyError
find_person(John="Engineer", Marco="Doctor")
```

Look at the line that checks for 'Ginni'. What happens when that key doesn't exist in the dictionary?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**The Bug**: The line `elif kwargs['Ginni']:` causes a `KeyError`. It attempts to access the key 'Ginni' directly, but this key does not exist in the second function call `find_person(John="Engineer", Marco="Doctor")`.

**The Fix**: Use the `in` keyword to safely check for the presence of a key in the dictionary before trying to access its value.

```python
def find_person(**kwargs):
    if "Ayu" in kwargs:
        print(f"Ayu's profession is {kwargs['Ayu']}")
    elif "Ginni" in kwargs:
        print("Ayu not found, but Ginni is present.")
    else:
        print("Ayu not found.")

# This call works fine
find_person(John="Engineer", Ayu="Software Engineer")

# This call now works without error
find_person(John="Engineer", Marco="Doctor")
```
