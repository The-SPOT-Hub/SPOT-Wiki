## Problem 60: Function Qualities

All functions in Python are first-class objects. Does this mean all functions are also higher-order functions? Explain your reasoning.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**No.** While all functions in Python are first-class objects, not all functions are higher-order functions.

- **First-class**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, etc.
- **Higher-order**: Functions must either take functions as arguments OR return functions

Example of a first-class function that is NOT higher-order:
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# This is first-class (can be assigned, passed around)
# But NOT higher-order (doesn't take or return functions)
```
