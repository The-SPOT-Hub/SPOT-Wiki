## Problem 91: Mutable State

What will the following code print? Explain how the closure maintains state.

```python
def make_counter():
    count = [0]
    def counter():
        count[0] += 1
        return count[0]
    return counter

counter1 = make_counter()
print(counter1())
print(counter1())

counter2 = make_counter()
print(counter2())
print(counter1())
```

```

**Explanation:**
- The closure uses a mutable object (list) to maintain state
- Each call to `make_counter()` creates a new list `[0]`
- `counter1` and `counter2` each have their own separate `count` list
- When `counter1()` is called, it modifies its own `count[0]`
- When `counter2()` is called, it modifies its own separate `count[0]`
- The state persists between calls because the list object is closed over
