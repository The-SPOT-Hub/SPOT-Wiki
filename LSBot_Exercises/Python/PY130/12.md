## Problem 12: Namespace Pollution

Explain what "namespace pollution" is in the context of Python modules. Which type of import statement is most likely to cause it, and why is it generally discouraged?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Namespace Pollution** occurs when importing modules introduces too many names into the current namespace, potentially causing naming conflicts and making code harder to understand and maintain.

**Import Statement Most Likely to Cause It:**
The `from module import *` statement (wildcard import) is most likely to cause namespace pollution.

**Why It's Problematic:**

```python
# BAD: Wildcard import causes namespace pollution
from math import *
from statistics import *

# Now your namespace is polluted with dozens of names
print(sin(1))     # Where does 'sin' come from? Not clear!
print(mean([1,2,3]))  # Where does 'mean' come from?

# What if both modules have a function with the same name?
# The second import will overwrite the first!
```

**Problems with Wildcard Imports:**

1. **Unclear Origin**: Hard to tell which module a function comes from
2. **Name Conflicts**: Functions from different modules might have the same name
3. **Hidden Dependencies**: Not obvious which modules your code depends on
4. **IDE/Editor Issues**: Auto-completion and static analysis tools struggle
5. **Maintenance Nightmare**: Difficult to track down bugs and understand code flow

**Better Alternatives:**

```python
# GOOD: Explicit imports
import math
import statistics

print(math.sin(1))
print(statistics.mean([1, 2, 3]))

# GOOD: Selective imports
from math import sin, cos, pi
from statistics import mean, median

print(sin(1))
print(mean([1, 2, 3]))

# GOOD: Aliased imports for long module names
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
plt.plot(arr)
```

**When Wildcard Imports Might Be Acceptable:**
- In interactive Python sessions for convenience
- When importing from modules specifically designed for it (like `tkinter.constants`)
- In certain testing scenarios
