## Problem 89: Free Variables

What is a "free variable" in the context of a closure?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A **free variable** is a variable that is used inside a function but is not defined locally within that function, nor is it a parameter of that function. Instead, it's defined in an outer (enclosing) scope.

In closures, free variables are the variables from the outer function that the inner function "closes over" or captures.

**Example:**
```python
def make_multiplier(factor):
    # 'factor' is a parameter of the outer function
    
    def multiply(number):
        # 'factor' is a free variable in this inner function
        # It's not defined locally, nor is it a parameter of multiply()
        # It comes from the enclosing scope
        return factor * number
    
    return multiply

times_3 = make_multiplier(3)
# The closure 'times_3' has captured the free variable 'factor' with value 3
```

In this example, `factor` is a free variable in the `multiply` function because it's referenced but not defined within `multiply`'s local scope.
