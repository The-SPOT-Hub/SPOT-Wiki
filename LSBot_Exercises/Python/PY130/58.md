## Problem 58: First-class vs Higher-order

Explain the difference between a first-class function and a higher-order function. Can a function be one without being the other?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Answer:**
- **First-class function**: A function that can be treated like any other object (passed around, assigned to variables, etc.)
- **Higher-order function**: A function that either takes functions as arguments or returns functions

**Yes, a function can be one without being the other:**
- All functions in Python are first-class objects by default
- But not all functions are higher-order functions (only those that take or return functions)
- Example: `def add(x, y): return x + y` is first-class but not higher-order
