## Problem 54: Reduce to Product

Using the `reduce` function and `numbers = [10, 3, 5]`, write a lambda to compute the product of all numbers, starting with an initial accumulator value of `1`. You may use `functools.reduce` or the custom `reduce` function from PY130.

With custom `reduce`:

```python
def reduce(callback, iterable, start):
    accum = start
    for item in iterable:
        accum = callback(item, accum)
    return accum

numbers = [10, 3, 5]
product = reduce(lambda num, accum: num * accum, numbers, 1)
print(product)  # 150
```

With `functools.reduce`:

```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [10, 3, 5]
product = reduce(lambda accum, num: accum * num, numbers, 1)
print(product)  # 150
```
