## Problem 87: Late Binding

What will the following code print? Explain the behavior.

```python
adders = []
for n in range(1, 4):
    adders.append(lambda x: n + x)

add1, add2, add3 = adders

print(add1(10))
print(add2(10))
print(add3(10))
```

```

**Explanation:**
This is the classic "late binding closure" problem. All lambda functions capture the same variable `n` by reference, not by value. When the loop completes, `n` has the value 3, so all lambda functions use 3 when called. The variable `n` is resolved at call time, not at definition time.
