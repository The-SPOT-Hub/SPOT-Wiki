## Problem 64: Nested Functions

What is the output of the following code? Explain the roles of `create_greeter` and `hello` in this example.

```python
def create_greeter(greeting):
    def hello(name):
        return f"{greeting}, {name}!"
    return hello

say_hi = create_greeter("Hi")
say_hola = create_greeter("Hola")

print(say_hi("Alice"))
print(say_hola("Bob"))
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Output:**

```
Hi, Alice!
Hola, Bob!
```

**Explanation of roles:**
- **`create_greeter`**: Higher-order function that returns a function. It's a "factory" that creates customized greeting functions
- **`hello`**: Inner function (closure) that captures the `greeting` parameter from its enclosing scope
- **`say_hi` and `say_hola`**: Variables that hold the returned `hello` functions, each with different captured `greeting` values
- This demonstrates **closures** - the inner function remembers the environment in which it was created
