# PY130 - Closures, Decorators & Partial Functions
## Problem 96: Counter with Closure

Write a function `make_counter()` that returns a counter function. Each time the counter function is called, it should return the next number in sequence (starting from 1).

## Examples:

```python
counter1 = make_counter()
counter2 = make_counter()

print(counter1())  # 1
print(counter1())  # 2
print(counter1())  # 3
print(counter2())  # 1
print(counter1())  # 4
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def make_counter():
    count = 0
    def counter():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return counter

# Create two independenter counters
counter1 = make_counter()
counter2 = make_counter()
```
