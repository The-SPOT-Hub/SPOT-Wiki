## Problem 9: Pure Functions

What is a pure function in Python? Describe its key characteristics and explain why pure functions are beneficial in software development. Provide one example of a pure function and one example of a function with side effects.

A **pure function** is a function with two key characteristics:

1. **Deterministic**: It always produces the same output for the same set of inputs.
2. **No Side Effects**: It does not modify any state outside of its own scope.

This means it doesn't change its input arguments, modify global variables, print to the console, or write to a file.

Pure functions are beneficial because they are predictable, easy to test, and easy to reason about. Their behavior doesn't depend on the program's state, which simplifies debugging and allows for optimizations like memoization.

**Pure Function Example**:
```python
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

**Function with Side Effects (Impure)**:
```python
shopping_list = []

def add_item(item):
    # Side effect: modifies a global variable
    shopping_list.append(item)
    # Side effect: prints to the console
    print(f"{item} was added to the list.")
```
