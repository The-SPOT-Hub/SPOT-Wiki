## Problem 19: Properties of Pure Functions

According to the Launch School curriculum, what are the two essential properties that a function must have to be considered a "pure function"? Create examples to demonstrate pure and impure functions.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

A function must have **two essential properties** to be considered pure:

1. **Deterministic**: Given the same input arguments, the function always returns the same output
2. **No Side Effects**: The function does not cause any observable changes outside of itself (no mutations, I/O operations, etc.)

**Examples:**

```python
# PURE FUNCTION - meets both criteria
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # Always returns same result for same inputs, no side effects

# IMPURE - not deterministic
import random
def roll_dice():
    return random.randint(1, 6)  # Different output each time

# IMPURE - has side effects
def add_and_print(a, b):
    result = a + b
    print(result)  # Side effect: prints to console
    return result
```
