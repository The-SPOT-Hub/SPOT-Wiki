## Problem 78: Numbers as Strings

Given the following data structure, use a generator expression to create a generator that yields each sublist ordered in ascending order **as strings** (that is, the numbers should be treated as strings). Convert the generator to a list and print the result.

```python
lst = [['b', 'c', 'a'], [2, 11, -3], ['blue', 'black', 'green']]
```

The expected result is `[['a', 'b', 'c'], [-3, 11, 2], ['black', 'blue', 'green']]`.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
lst = [['b', 'c', 'a'], [2, 11, -3], ['blue', 'black', 'green']]

# Generator expression sorting by string representation
sorted_generator = (sorted(sublist, key=str) for sublist in lst)

# Convert to list and print
print(list(sorted_generator))
# Output: [['a', 'b', 'c'], [-3, 11, 2], ['black', 'blue', 'green']]
```

**Explanation:**
- When sorting numbers as strings: `-3` < `11` < `2` (lexicographic order)
- This is because string comparison is character by character: `-` < `1` < `2`
