## Problem 21: Analyzing Function Purity

Is the following function pure? Why or why not?

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Yes, this function is pure.**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Deterministic**: For any given inputs `a` and `b`, it always returns the same result (`a + b`)
2. **No Side Effects**: It doesn't modify any external state, perform I/O, or cause any observable changes outside the function

This is a classic example of a pure function - it simply computes and returns a value based solely on its inputs.
