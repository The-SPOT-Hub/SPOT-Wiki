## Problem 22: Identifying Side Effects 

Identify the side effect in the following function.

```python
count = 10

def countdown():
    global count
    count -= 1
    print(count)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Two side effects:**

1. **Global State Modification**: `count -= 1` modifies the global variable `count`
2. **I/O Operation**: `print(count)` outputs to the console

**Pure version would be:**
```python
def countdown(current_count):
    return current_count - 1

# Usage:
count = 10
count = countdown(count)
print(count)  # Side effect moved outside the function
```

</details>
