## Problem 8: File Word Counter

Write a function `word_count` that takes a file path as an argument. The function should read the text file, count the frequency of each word (case-insensitive), and return a dictionary where keys are the words and values are their counts. For this exercise, assume words are separated by spaces and ignore punctuation by stripping it from the start and end of each word.

## Examples:

If a file `sample.txt` contains:
```
"Hello world! This is a test. Hello again."
```

The function should return:
```python
{'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'this': 1, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'test': 1, 'again': 1}
```

You'll need to use the `string` module to handle punctuation, and remember to handle file operations safely with try/except blocks.

```python
import string

def word_count(file_path):
    counts = {}
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                for word in line.split():
                    # Clean the word: remove punctuation and make it lowercase
                    cleaned_word = word.strip(string.punctuation).lower()
                    if cleaned_word: # Ensure the word is not empty after stripping
                        counts[cleaned_word] = counts.get(cleaned_word, 0) + 1
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Error: File not found."
    return counts

# To test this, create a file named 'sample.txt' with the content:
# "Hello world! This is a test. Hello again."
# print(word_count('sample.txt'))
# Expected output: {'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'this': 1, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'test': 1, 'again': 1}
```
