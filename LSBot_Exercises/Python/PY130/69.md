## Problem 69: Lazy Sequences

What does it mean that `map` and `filter` return a "lazy" sequence? How do you typically consume the results from these functions?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**"Lazy" sequence means:**
1. **No immediate computation** - `map` and `filter` return iterator objects, not lists
2. **Values computed on-demand** - results are generated only when requested
3. **Memory efficient** - doesn't store all results in memory at once
4. **Single-pass iteration** - can only be consumed once

**How to consume the results:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# map returns an iterator
doubled = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)
print(type(doubled))  # <class 'map'>

# Ways to consume:
# 1. Convert to list
doubled_list = list(doubled)
print(doubled_list)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# 2. Iterate directly
evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
for num in evens:
    print(num)  # 2, 4

# 3. Use next() for single items
squares = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
print(next(squares))  # 1
print(next(squares))  # 4
```
