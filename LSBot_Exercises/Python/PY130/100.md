## Problem 100: Understanding Partial Functions

What is a partial function in Python? Explain how `functools.partial` works and provide an example of when you would use it.

Partial function application is a technique where you fix a number of arguments to a function, which produces a new function that requires fewer arguments. This new function is a specialized version of the original, with some of its arguments already set.

In Python, the `functools.partial` utility is a standard way to achieve this. It creates a callable "partial object" that wraps the original function. When you call this new object, it invokes the original function with the pre-filled arguments you provided to partial, along with any new arguments you pass to the call.

A common use case is to create specialized functions from a more generic one, which can make your code more readable and reusable.

```python
from functools import partial
def add(a, b):
	return a + b


add10 = partial(add, 10)
print(add10(5)) # 15

add15 = partial(add, 15)
print(add15(5)) # 20
```
