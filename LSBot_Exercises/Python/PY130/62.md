## Problem 62: Assigning Functions

What will the following code output? Explain how functions as first-class objects enable this behavior.

```python
def double(n):
    return n * 2

def triple(n):
    return n * 3

operation = double
print(operation(5))

operation = triple
print(operation(5))
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Output:**

```
10
15
```

**Explanation:**

Functions as first-class objects enable this behavior because:
1. Functions can be **assigned to variables** (like `operation`)
2. The variable `operation` holds a **reference** to the function object
3. We can **call the function** through the variable using `operation(5)`
4. When we reassign `operation = triple`, it now points to the `triple` function
5. This enables **dynamic function assignment** at runtime
