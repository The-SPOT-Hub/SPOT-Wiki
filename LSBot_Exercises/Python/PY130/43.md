## Problem 43: 

Identify the syntax error in the following lambda expression and explain why it is an error based on the rules for lambdas.

```python
# Goal: return the number if it's even, otherwise return None
process_number = lambda x: if x % 2 == 0: x
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The syntax error is that this uses an incomplete `if` statement. Lambda functions cannot contain statements like `if`, only expressions. The correct way would be to use a conditional expression (ternary operator):

```python
process_number = lambda x: x if x % 2 == 0 else None
```
