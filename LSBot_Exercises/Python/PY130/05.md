## Problem 5: Generator vs List Comprehension

Explain the difference between a generator expression and a list comprehension in Python. What are the key advantages of using a generator expression over a list comprehension, especially concerning memory usage?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

The main difference is that a **list comprehension** creates and stores the entire list in memory at once, while a **generator expression** creates a generator object.

This generator produces items one by one (lazily) as they are needed, without storing the whole sequence in memory.

The key advantage of a generator expression is **memory efficiency**. Because it generates items on the fly, it's ideal for working with very large or even infinite sequences where creating a complete list would be impractical or consume too much memory.

- **List Comprehension**: `[x * 2 for x in range(5)]` -> `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`
- **Generator Expression**: `(x * 2 for x in range(5))` -> `<generator object ...>`
