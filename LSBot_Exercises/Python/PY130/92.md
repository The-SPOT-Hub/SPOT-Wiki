## Problem 92: Nested +=

What happens when you run the following code and call `bad_counter()`? Explain why.

```python
def make_bad_counter():
    count = 0
    def counter():
        count += 1
        return count
    return counter

bad_counter = make_bad_counter()
# bad_counter() # What happens here?
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Error:** `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment`

**Explanation:**
When Python sees `count += 1`, it interprets this as `count = count + 1`, which means `count` is being assigned to. Python treats any variable that's assigned to in a function as a local variable. However, the right side `count + 1` tries to read `count` before it's been assigned locally, causing the error.

The assignment operation makes Python treat `count` as local to the `counter` function, so it doesn't look in the enclosing scope for the variable.
