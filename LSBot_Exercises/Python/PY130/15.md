## Problem 15: What's a decorator?

What is a decorator in Python? Explain its purpose and the syntax used to apply it to a function.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A **decorator** in Python is a special type of function that modifies or extends the behavior of another function without permanently changing its code. Decorators follow the principle of "wrapping" a function with additional functionality.

**Purpose of Decorators:**
- Add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code
- Implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, timing, authentication, caching
- Provide a clean, reusable way to modify function behavior
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

**Basic Syntax:**

```python
# Method 1: Using @ symbol (syntactic sugar)
@decorator_function
def target_function():
    pass

# Method 2: Explicit decoration (equivalent to above)
def target_function():
    pass
target_function = decorator_function(target_function)
```

**Simple Example:**

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something before the function")
        result = func()
        print("Something after the function")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# When called:
say_hello()
# Output:
# Something before the function
# Hello!
# Something after the function
```

**Key Concepts:**
- The decorator function takes another function as an argument
- It returns a new function (usually called a "wrapper") that calls the original function
- The `@decorator` syntax is just syntactic sugar for `func = decorator(func)`
