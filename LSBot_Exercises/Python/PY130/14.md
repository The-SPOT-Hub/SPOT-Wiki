## Problem 14: Script vs Module Execution

In Python, a file can be used as either a script to be run directly or as a module to be imported. How can you write code within a file that executes only when the file is run as a script, but not when it is imported as a module? Provide a code example.

<summary>Solution:</summary>
Use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom. This checks whether the module is being run directly as a script or being imported.

**How It Works:**
- When a Python file is run directly, Python sets `__name__` to `"__main__"`
- When a Python file is imported as a module, Python sets `__name__` to the module's name

**Basic Example:**

```python
# utility_module.py
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

def main():
    print("Running utility_module as a script...")
    print(add_numbers(2, 3))
    print(multiply_numbers(4, 5))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When run directly (`python utility_module.py`), it executes `main()`. When imported (`import utility_module`), it doesn’t run `main()` and only exposes the functions.
