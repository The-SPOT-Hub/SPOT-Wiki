## Problem 93: Using nonlocal

Explain the purpose of the `nonlocal` keyword and write an example demonstrating how it's used.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `nonlocal` keyword allows a nested function to modify variables in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global. It tells Python that the variable is not local to the current function, but exists in an outer function's scope.

### Example:

```python
def make_counter():
    count = 0
    def counter():
        nonlocal count  # This tells Python to use the count from the outer scope
        count += 1
        return count
    return counter

# Example usage:
good_counter = make_counter()
print(good_counter())  # Output: 1
print(good_counter())  # Output: 2
print(good_counter())  # Output: 3

# Each counter maintains its own state
another_counter = make_counter()
print(another_counter())  # Output: 1
print(good_counter())     # Output: 4
```
