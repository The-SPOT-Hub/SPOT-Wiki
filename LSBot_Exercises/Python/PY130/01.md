## Problem 1: Understanding Closures

What is a closure in Python? Provide a simple code example of a closure and explain its primary use case.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

A closure is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created. Specifically, it's a function that has access to variables from its enclosing (outer) function's scope, even after the outer function has finished execution.

The primary use case for closures is to create functions with persistent private data, which is a way of achieving data encapsulation.

```python
def make_greeter(greeting):
    # The 'greeting' variable is part of the enclosing scope
    def greeter(name):
        # 'greeter' is a closure that "closes over" the 'greeting' variable
        return f"{greeting}, {name}!"
    return greeter

# Create two greeter functions, each with its own closed-over 'greeting'
greet_hello = make_greeter("Hello")
greet_goodbye = make_greeter("Goodbye")

print(greet_hello("Alice"))   # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(greet_goodbye("Bob"))   # Output: Goodbye, Bob!
```
