## Problem 88: Closures

In your own words, what is a closure in Python? What are its essential characteristics?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A **closure** in Python is a function that has access to variables from an outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. 

**Essential characteristics:**
1. **Nested Function**: A closure involves a function defined inside another function
2. **Access to Outer Variables**: The inner function can access variables from the outer function's scope
3. **Persistence**: The outer function's variables remain accessible even after the outer function returns
4. **State Preservation**: Each closure maintains its own copy of the outer function's variables

**Example:**
```python
def outer_function(x):
    # This variable will be "closed over"
    outer_var = x
    
    def inner_function(y):
        # This function can access outer_var
        return outer_var + y
    
    return inner_function  # Returns the closure

# outer_function has finished, but outer_var is still accessible
my_closure = outer_function(10)
print(my_closure(5))  # Output: 15
```
