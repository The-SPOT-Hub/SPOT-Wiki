## Problem 79: Partial

What will this code print? Try to answer without running the code:

```python
from functools import partial

def greet(name, greeting):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

say_hello_to = partial(greet, greeting="Hello")
print(say_hello_to(name="Alice"))  # What will this print?
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

It prints `"Hello, Alice!"`

**Explanation:** The `partial` function from the `functools` module creates a new version of the `greet` function with the `greeting` argument pre-filled as `"Hello"`. Thus, when `say_hello_to` is called with `"Alice"` as the name, it completes the call by using the pre-set greeting.
