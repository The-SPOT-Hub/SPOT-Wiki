## Problem 86: Keeping State

What does the following program print? Try to answer without running the code.

```python
def make_counter():
    def counter_func():
        counter = 0
        counter += 1
        return counter

    return counter_func

increment_counter = make_counter()
print(increment_counter())
print(increment_counter())

increment_counter = make_counter()
print(increment_counter())
print(increment_counter())
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

```
1
1
1
1
```

**Explanation:**
The `counter` variable is reinitialized to 0 every time `counter_func()` is called, so it always returns 1. The variable is not closed over from the outer scope, so state is not preserved between calls.
