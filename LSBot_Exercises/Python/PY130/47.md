## Problem 47: Divisible by 2 & 3

Given the list `numbers = list(range(1, 21))`, use `filter` and a lambda function to create a new list containing only the numbers divisible by both 2 and 3.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
numbers = list(range(1, 21))
divisible_by_6 = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0 and x % 3 == 0, numbers))
# Result: [6, 12, 18]
```
