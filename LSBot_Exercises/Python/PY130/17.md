## Problem 17: Simple Logger Decorator

Write a decorator named `simple_logger` that logs the execution of a function. It should print "Function is about to run" before the decorated function is called and "Function has finished running" after it completes. The decorator should correctly handle any arguments passed to the decorated function.

Apply this decorator to a function `greet(name)` that prints a greeting.

```python
def simple_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Function is about to run")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Function has finished running")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Apply to greet function
@simple_logger
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Example usage:
greet("Alice")
```

**Output:**
```
Function is about to run
Hello, Alice!
Function has finished running
```

**Enhanced Version with Function Name:**

```python
def simple_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' is about to run")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' has finished running")
        return result
    return wrapper

@simple_logger
def greet(name):
    """Greets a person by name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

@simple_logger
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Adds two numbers together."""
    return a + b

# Example usage:
greet("Bob")
print(f"Result: {add_numbers(5, 3)}")
```

**Output:**
```
Function 'greet' is about to run
Hello, Bob!
Function 'greet' has finished running
Result: Function 'add_numbers' is about to run
Function 'add_numbers' has finished running
8
```

**Version with Exception Handling:**

```python
def simple_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' is about to run")
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' has finished running successfully")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' finished with error: {e}")
            raise
    return wrapper

@simple_logger
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# Example usage:
print(divide(10, 2))  # Success case
# divide(10, 0)       # Error case (uncomment to test)
```
