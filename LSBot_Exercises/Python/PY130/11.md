## Problem 11: Modules

What is a module in Python? According to the Launch School curriculum, what are the two primary roles that modules serve?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

A **module** in Python is a file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code. Modules are identified by their `.py` file extension and serve as a way to organize and reuse code.

**Two Primary Roles of Modules:**

1. **Code Organization and Namespace Management**
   - Modules help organize related code into separate files
   - They create separate namespaces to avoid naming conflicts
   - They make code more maintainable and structured

2. **Code Reusability**
   - Modules allow code to be written once and used multiple times
   - They can be imported and used in different programs
   - They promote the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

**Example:**

```python
# math_operations.py (module)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

PI = 3.14159

# main.py (using the module)
import math_operations

result1 = math_operations.add(5, 3)
result2 = math_operations.multiply(4, 2)
print(f"PI value: {math_operations.PI}")
```

**Benefits of Using Modules:**
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage large codebases
- **Reusability**: Share code across multiple projects
- **Namespace separation**: Avoid naming conflicts
- **Modularity**: Break complex programs into manageable pieces
