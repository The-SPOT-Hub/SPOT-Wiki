What is a "callback function"? Write a simple example of a higher-order function that uses a callback.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

A **callback function** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called (invoked) within that function.

```python
def process_numbers(numbers, callback):
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(callback(num))
    return result

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# square is the callback function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = process_numbers(numbers, square)
print(squared)  # [1, 4, 9, 16]
```
