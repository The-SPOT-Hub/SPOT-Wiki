## Problem 95: Running Average Calculator

Write a function `running_average()` that returns a new function. The returned function, when called with a number, should return the running average of all numbers passed to it since it was created.

```python
# Example usage:
avg_calculator = running_average()
print(avg_calculator(10)) # Expected: 10.0
print(avg_calculator(20)) # Expected: 15.0
print(avg_calculator(30)) # Expected: 20.0

avg_calculator2 = running_average()
print(avg_calculator2(5)) # Expected: 5.0
```

```python
def running_average():
    """
    Returns a function that calculates the running average of all numbers passed to it.
    """
    numbers = []
    
    def add_number(num):
        numbers.append(num)
        return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    return add_number

# Example usage:
avg_calculator = running_average()
print(avg_calculator(10))  # Output: 10.0
print(avg_calculator(20))  # Output: 15.0
print(avg_calculator(30))  # Output: 20.0

avg_calculator2 = running_average()
print(avg_calculator2(5))  # Output: 5.0
print(avg_calculator2(15)) # Output: 10.0

# Original calculator still maintains its own state
print(avg_calculator(40))  # Output: 25.0 (10+20+30+40)/4
```
