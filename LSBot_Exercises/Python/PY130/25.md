## Problem 25: Exception Handling and Purity

Is the following function `find_max` a pure function? Explain your reasoning.

```python
def find_max(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    return max(numbers)
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**This is a borderline case, but generally considered impure** due to the exception.

**Arguments for impurity:**
- **Side Effect**: Raising an uncaught exception is considered a side effect because it changes the program's control flow
- **Observable Effect**: The exception can be caught and handled outside the function

**Arguments for purity:**
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same result (value or exception)
- **No External Mutation**: Doesn't modify external state

**Pure alternative:**

```python
def find_max_pure(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None  # Or return a tuple (success, value)
    return max(numbers)
```

**Industry perspective**: Many consider functions that raise exceptions as having side effects, making them technically impure, even though they're deterministic.
