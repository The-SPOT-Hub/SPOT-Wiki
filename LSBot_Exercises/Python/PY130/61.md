## Problem 61: Is `print` Higher-order?

Using the refined definition from the PY130 course material, explain why the built-in `print` function is not considered a true higher-order function, even though you can pass a function object to it as an argument.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `print` function is not considered a true higher-order function because:

1. **It doesn't operate ON the function** - it treats the function object like any other object
2. **It doesn't invoke/call the function** - it just prints the function's string representation
3. **True higher-order functions** are designed to work with functions as functional units, not just as objects

Example:
```python
def my_func():
    return "hello"

print(my_func)  # Prints: <function my_func at 0x...>
# print doesn't call my_func or use it functionally
```

</details>
