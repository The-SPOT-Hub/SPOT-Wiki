## Problem 3: Closure Variable Scope Bug

The following function is intended to create a list of multiplier functions. Each function `multipliers[i]` should multiply its argument by `i`. However, the code doesn't work as expected. Identify the bug, explain the issue related to closures and variable scope, and provide a corrected version.

```python
multipliers = []
for i in range(5):
    def multiplier(x):
        return i * x
    multipliers.append(multiplier)

# This call is expected to return 2 * 10 = 20
# but it returns something else.
print(multipliers[2](10))
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**The Bug**: The issue is caused by late binding in closures. All the multiplier functions created in the loop share a reference to the same variable `i`. When the loop finishes, `i` has the value 4. Therefore, every function in the `multipliers` list will use 4 for `i`, not the value `i` had when the function was defined.

**Corrected Version**: The fix is to capture the value of `i` at each iteration. A common way to do this is by using a default argument.

```python
multipliers = []
for i in range(5):
    # Use a default argument to capture the current value of i
    def multiplier(x, i=i):
        return i * x
    multipliers.append(multiplier)

# Expected to return 2 * 10 = 20
print(multipliers[2](10)) # Output: 20

# All functions now work as expected
print(multipliers[0](10)) # Output: 0
print(multipliers[1](10)) # Output: 10
print(multipliers[3](10)) # Output: 30
print(multipliers[4](10)) # Output: 40
```
