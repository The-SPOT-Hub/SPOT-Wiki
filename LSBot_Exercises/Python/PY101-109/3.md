# Python 101-109
## Problem 3

What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```Python
month = "December"
day = int(input("What day is it? "))
print(f"Today is the {day} of {month}")
```

  <summary>Answer:</summary>
  The user is prompted for the day of the week. The value from the user is explicitly coerced into an integer with the int() function and assigned to the variable day. The print() function is called with an f-string prefix which allows string interpolation. Any expressions within the {} are replaced by the value of the expressions. The values are coerced implicitly into strings The concepts demonstrated here are string interpolation and both explicit and implicit coercion.
