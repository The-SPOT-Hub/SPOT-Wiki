## Problem 16

What do these print and why?

```Python
s1 = "Hello"
print(s1.isalpha())
s2 = "Hello World"
print(s2.isalpha())
s3 = "Hello!"
print(s3.isalpha())
s4 = "Hello123"
print(s4.isalpha())
s5 = ""
print(s5.isalpha())
s6 = "こんにちは"
print(s6.isalpha())
s7 = "HelloWorld"
print(s7.isalpha())
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(all(word.isalpha() for word in words))
```

The output will be:
```
True
False
False
False
False
True
True
True
```

The `.isalpha()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character. It returns `False` if the string contains non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, punctuation, or numbers) or if the string is empty. Unicode characters are considered alphabetic. The final print statement uses the `all()` function to check if every string in the words list is alphabetic, which they are, returning `True`.
