# Python 101-109
## Problem 18

What do these print and why?

```Python
s1 = "123abc"
print(s1.isdigit())
s2 = "123$%^"
print(s2.isdigit())
s3 = ""
print(s3.isdigit())
s4 = "12345"
print(s4.isdigit())
```

The output will be:
```
False
False
False
True
```

The `.isdigit()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character. It returns `False` for s1 because of the alphabetic characters, s2 because of the symbols, and s3 because it is an empty string. It returns `True` for s4 because all characters are digits.
