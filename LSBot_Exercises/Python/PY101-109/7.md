## Problem 7

What does this print and why? What concept does this cover? How would you refactor this to remove the space?

```Python
print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2))
```

This will output 14 20 to the screen. Integers can be added together within a print function. The comma allows multiple different mathematical calculations to occur within the same `print()` function call. To remove the space in the output, use the optional `sep` parameter with an empty string, like so: `print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2), sep='')`. The main concept here is order of operations, and the use of commas to allow for separate mathematical operations within a `print()` function.
