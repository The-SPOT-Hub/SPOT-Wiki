# Python 101-109
## Problem 12

What does this print and why, what is the concept?

```Python
name = 'Abraham Lincoln'
print(f"{name} was a President of the US")
```

<summary>Answer:</summary>

This will print Abraham Lincoln was a President of the US. The f prefix in the print function allows the value of the variable to be interpolated and merged with the rest of the print statement. This demonstrates f-strings.
