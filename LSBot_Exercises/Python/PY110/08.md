## Problem 8: Smallest Substring Repeat

Write a function that takes a non-empty string `s` as input and finds the
minimum substring `t` and the maximum number `k`, such that the entire string
`s` is equal to `t` repeated `k` times.

## Examples:

```python
f("ababab") # should return ["ab", 3]
```
