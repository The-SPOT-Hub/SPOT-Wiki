## Problem 4: Alphabet Symmetry

Write a function that takes two strings as input, `full_text` and `search_text`,
and returns the number of times `search_text` appears in `full_text`.

## Examples:

```python
solution('abcdeb','b') # should return 2 since 'b' shows up twice
solution('aaabbbcccc', 'bbb') # should return 1
```
