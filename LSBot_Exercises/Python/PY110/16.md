## Problem 16: Spin Words

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words and returns the same string, but with all words of five or more letters reversed. Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

## Examples:

```python
# The below tests should each print True.
print(spin_words("Hey fellow warriors") == "Hey wollef sroirraw")
print(spin_words("This is a test") == "This is a test")
print(spin_words("This is another test") == "This is rehtona test")
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def spin_words(text):
    result = []

    words = text.split()

    for word in words:
        if len(word) >=5:
            result.append(word[::-1])
        else:
            result.append(word)

    return " ".join(result)
```
