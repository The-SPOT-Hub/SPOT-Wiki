## Problem 14: Dubstep

Write a function to decode a dubstep string to its original form. The string may begin and end with one or more "WUB"s and there will be at least one (and possibly more) "WUB"s between each word.

The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase
English letters.

## Examples:

```python
# The below tests should each print True.
print(song_decoder("WUBWEWUBAREWUBWUBTHEWUBCHAMPIONSWUBMYWUBFRIENDWUB") == "WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND")
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def song_decoder(s):
    result = s.replace("WUB", " ").split()
    return " ".join(result)
```
