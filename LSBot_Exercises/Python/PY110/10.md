## Problem 10: Most Frequent Words

Write a function that, given a string of text, returns a list of the top-3 most
occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.

Assumptions:
- A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (').
- Matches should be case-insensitive.
- Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
- If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty list if a text contains no words.


## Examples:

```python
top_3_words(" , e .. ") # ["e"]
top_3_words(" ... ") # []
top_3_words(" ' ") # []
top_3_words(" ''' ") # []
top_3_words("""In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.""") # should return ["a", "of", "on"]
```
