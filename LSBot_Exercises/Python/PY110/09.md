## Problem 9: Typoglycemia Generator

Write a function that generates text following a pattern where:
1) the first and last characters of each word remain in their original place
2) characters between the first and last characters are sorted alphabetically
3) punctuation should remain at the same place as it started

## Examples:

```python
scramble_words('professionals') # should return 'paefilnoorsss'
scramble_words("you've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, love like you'll never be hurt, sing like there's nobody listening, and live like it's heaven on earth.") # should return "you've gotta dacne like teehr's nbdooy wachintg, love like ylo'ul neevr be hrut, sing like teehr's nbdooy leiinnstg, and live like it's haeevn on earth."
```

```python
def scramble_word(word):
    if len(word) <= 2:
        return word

    first = word[0]
    last = word[-1]
    middle = word[1:-1]

    # Sort only letters
    letters = sorted(c for c in middle if c.isalpha())

    # Rebuild middle: replace letters in order, keep non-letters at their position
    new_middle = []
    letter_index = 0
    for c in middle:
        if c.isalpha():
            new_middle.append(letters[letter_index])
            letter_index += 1
        else:
            new_middle.append(c)

    return first + ''.join(new_middle) + last

def scramble_words(text):
    result = []
    word = []

    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha() or char in ["'", "-"]:  # treat ' and - as part of the word
            word.append(char)
        else:
            if word:
                result.append(scramble_word(''.join(word)))
                word = []
            result.append(char)

    if word:
        result.append(scramble_word(''.join(word)))

    return ''.join(result)
```
