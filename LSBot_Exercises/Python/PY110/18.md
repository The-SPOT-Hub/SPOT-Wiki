## Problem 18: Multiplicative Persistence

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter
`num` and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number
of times you must multiply the digits in `num` until you reach a single digit.

## Examples:

```python
# The below tests should each print True.
print(persistence(39) == 3) # should return 3, because 3*9=27, 2*7=14, 1*4=4 and 4 has only one digit
print(persistence(999) == 4) # should return 4, because 9*9*9=729, 7*2*9=126, 1*2*6=12, and finally 1*2=2
print(persistence(4) == 0) # should return 0, because 4 is already a one-digit number
print(persistence(25) == 2) # should return 2, because 2*5=10, and 1*0=0
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def persistence(digits):
    if digits < 10:
        return 0

    s = str(digits)
    count = 0

    while len(s) >= 2:
        product = 1
        
        for digit in s:
            product *= int(digit)
        count += 1

        s = str(product)
    
    return(count)
```
