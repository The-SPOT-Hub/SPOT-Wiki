## Problem 12: Alphabet Symmetry

Write a function that takes a list of words as input and returns a list of
integers. Each integer represents the count of letters in the word that occupy
their positions in the alphabet. 

For example, in the word "abode", the first letter "a" is in the first position of the alphabet and should be counted. "b" is in the second position of the alphabet and should also be counted. "o" is not in the third position of the alphabet and should not be counted.

You can use the following helper function.

```python
def letter_position(letter):
    return ord(letter) - 96

print(letter_position("a")) # returns 1
print(letter_position("z")) # returns 26
```

## Examples:

```python
# The below tests should each print True.
print(count_letters_in_position(["abode", "ABc", "xyzD"]) == [4, 3, 1])
print(count_letters_in_position(["abide", "ABc","xyz"]) == [4, 3, 0])
print(count_letters_in_position(["IAM", "CODING", "HELP"]) == [0, 0, 0])
print(count_letters_in_position(["", "a", "b", "c"]) == [0, 1, 0, 0])
```

```python
def count_letters_in_position(words):
    result = []

    for word in words:
        word = word.lower()
        count = 0
        for idx, char in enumerate(word):
            if idx + 1 == letter_position(char):
                count += 1

        result.append(count)
    
    return result
        

def letter_position(letter):
    return ord(letter) - 96
```
