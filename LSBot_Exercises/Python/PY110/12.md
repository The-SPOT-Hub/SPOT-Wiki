## Problem 12: Detect the Pangram

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at
least once. Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram.
Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Examples:

```python
pangram("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") # should return True
pangram("This is not a pangram.") # should return False
```
