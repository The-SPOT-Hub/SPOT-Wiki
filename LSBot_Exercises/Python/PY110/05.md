## Problem 5: Longest Chain of Vowels

Write a function that takes a lowercase string as input and returns the
length of the longest substring that consists entirely of vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

## Examples:

```python
solve("roadwarriors") # should return 2
solve("suoidea") # should return 3
```

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def solve(string):
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    
    for char in string:
        if char in vowels:
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 0
    
    return max_length
```
