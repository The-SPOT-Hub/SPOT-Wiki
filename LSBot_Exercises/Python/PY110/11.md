## Problem 11: Extract the domain name from a URL

Write a function that, given a URL as a string, parses out just the domain
name and returns it.

## Examples:

```python
domain_name("http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun") # should return "github"
domain_name("https://www.cnet.com") # should return "cnet"
```
