## Problem 37

What is output and why? How could we output a message of our choice instead?

```ruby
class GoodDog
  DOG_YEARS = 7

  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(n, a)
    self.name = n
    self.age  = a * DOG_YEARS
  end
end

sparky = GoodDog.new("Sparky", 4)
puts sparky
```

How is the output above different than the output of the code below, and why?

```ruby
class GoodDog
  DOG_YEARS = 7

  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(n, a)
    @name = n
    @age  = a * DOG_YEARS
  end
end

sparky = GoodDog.new("Sparky", 4)
p sparky
```
