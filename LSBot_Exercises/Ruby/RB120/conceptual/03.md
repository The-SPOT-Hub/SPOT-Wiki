## Problem 3

What is output and why? What does this demonstrate about constant scope? What does `self` refer to in each of the 3 methods above?

```ruby
module Describable
  def describe_shape
    "I am a #{self.class} and have #{SIDES} sides."
  end
end

class Shape
  include Describable

  def self.sides
    self::SIDES
  end
  
  def sides
    self.class::SIDES
  end
end

class Quadrilateral < Shape
  SIDES = 4
end

class Square < Quadrilateral; end

p Square.sides 
p Square.new.sides 
p Square.new.describe_shape
```
