## Problem 16

What does the code below output, and why? What does this demonstrate about class variables, and why we should avoid using class variables when working with inheritance?

```ruby
class Vehicle
  @@wheels = 4

  def self.wheels
    @@wheels
  end
end

p Vehicle.wheels                             

class Motorcycle < Vehicle
  @@wheels = 2
end

p Motorcycle.wheels                           
p Vehicle.wheels                              

class Car < Vehicle; end

p Vehicle.wheels
p Motorcycle.wheels                           
p Car.wheels   
```
