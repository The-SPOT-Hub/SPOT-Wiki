```ruby
# Originally by Natalie Thompson, this version by James Wilson

class Wizard
  attr_reader :name, :hitpoints
  
  def initialize(name, hitpoints)
    @name = name
    @hitpoints = hitpoints
  end  
  
  def fireball
    "casts Fireball for 500 damage!"
  end
  
end

class Summoner < Wizard
  attr_reader :souls
  
  def initialize(name, hitpoints)
    # only add one line here
    @souls = []
  end
  
  def soul_steal(character)
    @souls << character
  end
end

gandolf = Summoner.new("Gandolf", 100)
p gandolf.name # => "Gandolf"

valdimar = Wizard.new("Valdimar", 200)
p valdimar.fireball #=> "casts fireball for 500 damage!"

p gandolf.hitpoints #=> 100

p gandolf.soul_steal(valdimar) #=> [#<Wizard:0x000055d782470810 @name="Valdimar", @hitpoints=200>]

p gandolf.souls[0].fireball #=> "casts fireball for 500 damage!"
```
