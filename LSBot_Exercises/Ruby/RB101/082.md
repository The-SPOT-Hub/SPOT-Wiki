## Problem 82: Same Precedence Evaluation

How are operations evaluated when there are two operators **of the same precedence**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Left to right (left-associative) for most operators.

When operators have the same precedence level, Ruby evaluates them from left to right.

Examples:
```ruby
# Left-to-right evaluation:
result = 10 - 5 - 2  # Evaluated as (10 - 5) - 2 = 3
                     # NOT as 10 - (5 - 2) = 7

result = 20 / 4 / 2  # Evaluated as (20 / 4) / 2 = 2
                     # NOT as 20 / (4 / 2) = 10

result = 100 - 50 + 25  # (100 - 50) + 25 = 75
```

**Assignment is right-associative:**
```ruby
# Right-to-left for assignment:
x = y = z = 10  # Evaluated as x = (y = (z = 10))
p x  # => 10
p y  # => 10
p z  # => 10
```

**Ruby precedence reference:**

You can find the full precedence table at: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/precedence_rdoc.html

**Key precedence levels (high to low):**
1. `[]`, `.` (element reference, method call)
2. `**` (exponentiation)
3. Unary `+`, `-`, `!`, `~`
4. `*`, `/`, `%`
5. `+`, `-` (binary)
6. `<<`, `>>`
7. `&`
8. `|`, `^`
9. `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
10. `==`, `!=`, `===`
11. `&&`
12. `||`
13. `..`, `...`
14. Ternary `? :`
15. Assignment `=`, `+=`, etc.
