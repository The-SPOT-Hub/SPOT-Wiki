## Problem 69: False vs Falsy

Is `false` falsy? Is falsy `false`?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, `false` is falsy.

No, falsy is not always `false`. In Ruby, both `false` and `nil` are falsy.

Examples:
```ruby
# false is falsy
if false
  puts "Won't print"
end

# nil is also falsy
if nil
  puts "Won't print"
end

# Checking equality
puts false == nil   # => false (they're not equal to each other)
puts false == false # => true
puts nil == nil     # => true

# But both are falsy
puts !!false  # => false (falsy)
puts !!nil    # => false (falsy)
```

**The two falsy values:**
```ruby
# Only these are falsy:
nil
false

# Everything else is truthy (including things you might not expect):
0           # Truthy
""          # Truthy
[]          # Truthy
{}          # Truthy
"false"     # Truthy (it's a string!)
"nil"       # Truthy (it's a string!)
```
