## Problem 37: Mutable vs Immutable

What does it mean for a data type to be **mutable** or **immutable**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Immutable** means the object's state or value cannot be changed after it's created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object.

**Mutable** means the object can be modified in place - its state or value can be changed without creating a new object.

Examples:
```ruby
# Immutable - integers
num = 10
original_id = num.object_id
num += 5  # Creates new object
num.object_id == original_id  # => false

# Mutable - arrays
arr = [1, 2, 3]
original_id = arr.object_id
arr << 4  # Modifies same object
arr.object_id == original_id  # => true
```

```ruby
# Immutable - symbols
sym = :hello
# Cannot modify a symbol in any way

# Mutable - strings
str = "hello"
original_id = str.object_id
str << " world"  # Modifies same object
str.object_id == original_id  # => true
```
