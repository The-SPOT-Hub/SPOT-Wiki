## Problem 106: Block Scope and Variable Access

Explain what happens when we run this code and the output we will get.

```ruby
greeting = 'Hello'
  
loop do
  greeting = 'Howdy'
  farewell = 'Goodbye'
  p greeting  # what will be output by this line?
  p farewell  # what will be output by this line?
  break
end
  
p greeting  # what will be output by this line?
p farewell  # what will be output by this line?
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. How many `greeting` variables exist in this code? How many `farewell`?
2. What's the difference between the action happening on lines 4 & 5?
3. What are three distinct ways we could fix this code to get `Howdy` and `Goodbye` as our only greetings that are output?

**Output:**
```
"Howdy"
"Goodbye"
"Howdy"
NameError: undefined local variable or method `farewell'
```

**Explanation:**

1. `greeting = 'Hello'` creates a variable in the outer scope
2. Inside the loop block:
   - `greeting = 'Howdy'` **reassigns** the outer `greeting` (doesn't create new variable)
   - `farewell = 'Goodbye'` **initializes** a new variable local to the block
   - `p greeting` outputs `"Howdy"`
   - `p farewell` outputs `"Goodbye"`
   - `break` exits the loop
3. After the loop:
   - `p greeting` outputs `"Howdy"` (it was reassigned in the block)
   - `p farewell` raises a `NameError` (farewell was only in block scope)

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: 
- One `greeting` variable (defined outside, reassigned inside)
- One `farewell` variable (defined inside block only)

**Bonus 2**: The difference between lines 4 & 5:

Line 4 (`greeting = 'Howdy'`): **Reassignment** - `greeting` already exists in outer scope, so this reassigns it

Line 5 (`farewell = 'Goodbye'`): **Initialization** - `farewell` doesn't exist yet, so this creates a new variable local to the block

```ruby
# How Ruby decides:
outer_var = 1
[1].each do |n|
  outer_var = 2  # Reassignment (outer_var exists)
  new_var = 3    # Initialization (new_var doesn't exist)
end
```

**Bonus 3**: Three ways to fix it:

**Option 1: Initialize `farewell` before the loop**
```ruby
greeting = 'Hello'
farewell = nil  # Initialize in outer scope

loop do
  greeting = 'Howdy'
  farewell = 'Goodbye'  # Now reassigns outer variable
  p greeting
  p farewell
  break
end

p greeting
p farewell
```

**Option 2: Only print inside the loop**
```ruby
greeting = 'Hello'

loop do
  greeting = 'Howdy'
  farewell = 'Goodbye'
  p greeting
  p farewell
  break
end
# Remove the outer p statements
```

**Option 3: Use a method to return values**
```ruby
def get_greetings
  greeting = 'Howdy'
  farewell = 'Goodbye'
  p greeting
  p farewell
  [greeting, farewell]
end

greeting, farewell = get_greetings
p greeting
p farewell
```
