## Problem 96: Accessing Outside Variables in Methods

How can we access local variables that are defined *outside* of a method definition from *within* a method definition?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You cannot directly access local variables from outside a method definition. Methods create their own scope and cannot see local variables from the outer scope.

To use values from outside a method, you must:
1. Pass them as arguments
2. Use instance variables, class variables, or global variables (for object-oriented code)
3. Use constants (if the values don't change)

Examples:
```ruby
# This does NOT work:
outer_var = 10

def my_method
  # puts outer_var  # NameError: undefined local variable
end

# This DOES work - using parameters:
outer_var = 10

def my_method(var)
  puts var
end

my_method(outer_var)  # => 10

# This DOES work - using constants:
GREETING = "Hello"

def greet(name)
  puts "#{GREETING}, #{name}!"  # Can access constants
end

greet("Alice")  # => "Hello, Alice!"

# This DOES work - using global variables (generally not recommended):
$global = 10

def my_method
  puts $global  # Can access global variables
end

my_method  # => 10
```

**Key difference from blocks:**
```ruby
# Blocks CAN access outer local variables:
outer_var = 10
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts outer_var + num  # Works! Blocks can access outer scope
end

# Methods CANNOT:
outer_var = 10
def my_method
  # puts outer_var  # Error! Methods cannot access outer scope
end
```
