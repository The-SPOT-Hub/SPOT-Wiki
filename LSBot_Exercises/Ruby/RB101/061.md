## Problem 61: Variables and Array Elements

Predict the output of this snippet and explain why.

```ruby
num1 = 1
arr1 = [num1, 2, 3]

num1 = 42

p arr1 # What is output by this line?

arr1[0] = 42

p arr1 # What is output by this line?
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Does `arr1` contain the variable `num1` as an element?
2. Is there anything we can do to `num1` to change the value at index 0 in our array?
3. What could we do instead of line 7 (`arr1[0] = 42`) that would have the same outcome on line 9?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**First `p arr1` outputs:** `[1, 2, 3]`

**Second `p arr1` outputs:** `[42, 2, 3]`

**Explanation:**

When we create `arr1 = [num1, 2, 3]`, the array stores a reference to the object that `num1` points to (the integer `1`), not the variable `num1` itself. 

When we reassign `num1 = 42`, this doesn't affect the array because the array still points to the original integer `1`. Integers are immutable, so the original `1` cannot be changed.

On line 7, we directly mutate the array by changing the element at index 0 to `42`, which is why the second print shows `[42, 2, 3]`.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: No, `arr1` does not contain the variable `num1`. It contains a reference to the object that `num1` pointed to when the array was created (the integer `1`).

```ruby
num1 = 1
arr1 = [num1, 2, 3]

# arr1[0] and num1 point to the same object initially
arr1[0].object_id == num1.object_id  # => true (for small integers)

num1 = 99  # Reassign num1
arr1[0] == num1  # => false (arr1[0] is still 1)
```

**Bonus 2**: No, there's nothing we can do to `num1` to change the value at index 0. Since integers are immutable and the array doesn't reference the variable `num1`, modifying `num1` has no effect on the array.

**Bonus 3**: We could use:

```ruby
# Option 1: Remove first element, add new one
arr1.shift
arr1.unshift(42)

# Option 2: Use augmented assignment
arr1[0] += 41  # arr1[0] = arr1[0] + 41 => 1 + 41 = 42

# Both achieve the same result as arr1[0] = 42
```
