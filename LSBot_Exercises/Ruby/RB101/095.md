## Problem 95: What is a Local Variable?

What is a local variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A local variable is a variable that is accessible only within a specific scope - typically within a method, block, or the main program scope where it's defined.

Local variables are created when they're first assigned and destroyed when their scope ends.

Examples:
```ruby
def my_method
  local_var = 10  # This is a local variable
  puts local_var
end

my_method  # => 10
# puts local_var  # NameError: undefined local variable

# Block scope:
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  doubled = num * 2  # Local to the block
  puts doubled
end
# puts doubled  # NameError

# Main scope:
greeting = "Hello"  # Local to main scope
def say_hello
  # puts greeting  # NameError: can't access from method
end
```

**Local variable naming:**
```ruby
# Local variables start with lowercase letter or underscore
my_var = 5
_temp = 10
count = 0

# Not local variables:
CONSTANT = 100  # Constant
@instance_var = 5  # Instance variable
@@class_var = 5  # Class variable
$global_var = 5  # Global variable
```
