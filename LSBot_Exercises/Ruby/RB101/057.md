## Problem 57: Do We Mutate Variables?

Do we **mutate** variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, we don't mutate variables. Variables are just names that point to objects. We mutate the objects themselves, not the variables. Reassigning a variable makes it point to a different object, but that's not mutationâ€”it's reassignment.

Examples:
```ruby
my_arr = [1, 2, 3]
my_arr << 4         # This mutates the array object, not the variable
my_arr = [5, 6, 7]  # This reassigns the variable to point to a different array
```

**What gets mutated:**
```ruby
str = "hello"
str_id = str.object_id

str << " world"  # Mutates the string object
str.object_id == str_id  # => true (same object)

str = "goodbye"  # Reassigns the variable (doesn't mutate anything)
str.object_id == str_id  # => false (different object)
```

**Clarification:**
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]

# Mutation - modifying the object:
arr.push(4)
arr[0] = 99
arr.delete_at(1)

# Reassignment - pointing to a different object:
arr = [4, 5, 6]
arr = []
arr = Array.new
```

**Why this matters:**
```ruby
def modify(array)
  array << 4  # Mutates the object
end

def reassign(array)
  array = [4, 5, 6]  # Only reassigns the local variable
end

arr = [1, 2, 3]
modify(arr)
p arr  # => [1, 2, 3, 4] (object was mutated)

arr = [1, 2, 3]
reassign(arr)
p arr  # => [1, 2, 3] (original object unchanged)
```
