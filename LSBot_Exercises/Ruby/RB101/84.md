## Problem 84: Parentheses for Clarity

Assuming that parentheses aren't required, should we *use* parentheses to add clarity, or *omit* parentheses to avoid clutter?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

It's generally a good practice to use parentheses for clarity, even if they are not strictly required. This makes code easier to read and understand, reducing the risk of logical errors.

**Examples of using parentheses for clarity:**

```ruby
# Without parentheses (correct but potentially confusing):
if x > 5 && y < 10 || z == 0
  puts "Condition met"
end

# With parentheses (clearer intent):
if (x > 5 && y < 10) || (z == 0)
  puts "Condition met"
end

# Another example:
result = a + b * c / d  # Works, but precedence isn't obvious

result = a + ((b * c) / d)  # Clearer, even if redundant
```

**When parentheses help:**
```ruby
# Complex logical conditions
if user.active? && user.verified? || user.admin? && user.premium?
  # Hard to read
end

if (user.active? && user.verified?) || (user.admin? && user.premium?)
  # Much clearer
end

# Method arguments
puts calculate 5, 10  # Ambiguous

puts calculate(5, 10)  # Clear
```

**When parentheses might be unnecessary:**
```ruby
# Simple, obvious operations
x = 5 + 3      # No need for x = (5 + 3)
if x > 10      # No need for if (x > 10)
```

**Balance clarity and readability:**
- Use parentheses when the operation order isn't immediately obvious
- Use them to group related operations
- Don't overuse them to the point of clutter
