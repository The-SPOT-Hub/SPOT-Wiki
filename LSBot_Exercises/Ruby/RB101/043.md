## Problem 43: What Does Initialize Mean?

What does it mean to **initialize** a variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

To initialize means to create a variable and assign it an initial value for the first time.

**Note:** In Ruby, initialization and reassignment use identical syntax - both use the `=` operator.

Examples:
```ruby
# Initialization - creating the variable for the first time
name = "Alice"

# Reassignment - changing the value (looks the same!)
name = "Bob"
```

```ruby
# First time we see 'count' - initialization
count = 0

# Later changes - reassignment
count = count + 1
count += 1
```

**Why the distinction matters:**
```ruby
# In a method with a block
def example
  # 'result' is initialized here
  result = 0
  
  [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
    # This reassigns the outer 'result'
    result += num
  end
  
  result  # => 6
end
```

```ruby
# If we try to reassign without initializing first
# In a block context:
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  total = 0  # This is initialization, happens each iteration!
  total += num
end
# 'total' is not accessible here - it's scoped to the block
```

**Best practice:**
- Initialize variables before using them
- Be mindful of scope when initializing inside blocks
