## Problem 60: Reassignment and Mutation

Is reassignment ever mutating?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, reassignment is never mutating. Reassignment changes which object a variable points to, but it doesn't modify (mutate) any existing object. Mutation changes the internal state of an object, while reassignment just redirects the variable to a different object.

Examples:
```ruby
# Reassignment - NOT mutation
x = [1, 2, 3]
x = [4, 5, 6]  # x now points to a different array; original array unchanged

# Mutation - NOT reassignment
y = [1, 2, 3]
y << 4         # y still points to the same array, but the array is modified
```

**Visualizing the difference:**
```ruby
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr1_id = arr1.object_id

# Reassignment:
arr1 = [4, 5, 6]
arr1.object_id == arr1_id  # => false (different object)

arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2_id = arr2.object_id

# Mutation:
arr2 << 4
arr2.object_id == arr2_id  # => true (same object, modified)
```

**Why this matters in methods:**
```ruby
def reassign_it(str)
  str = "goodbye"  # Only reassigns local variable
end

def mutate_it(str)
  str << " world"  # Mutates the object
end

text = "hello"
reassign_it(text)
p text  # => "hello" (unchanged)

text = "hello"
mutate_it(text)
p text  # => "hello world" (mutated)
```

**Element reassignment in arrays:**
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr_id = arr.object_id

arr[0] = 99  # This mutates the array, not reassigns it
arr.object_id == arr_id  # => true (same array, different contents)

# We're reassigning which object is at index 0,
# but we're mutating the array structure itself
```

**Key distinction:**
- **Reassignment**: `variable = new_object` → variable points elsewhere
- **Mutation**: `object.method!` or `object[index] = value` → object changes internally
