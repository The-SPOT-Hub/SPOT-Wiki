## Problem 38: Mutable Types

What are some of the **mutable** types in Ruby?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The main mutable types in Ruby are:
- String (e.g., `"hello"`, `'world'`)
- Array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b']`)
- Hash (e.g., `{name: 'John', age: 30}`)

These types can be modified in place without creating new objects.

Examples:
```ruby
# Mutable string
str = "hello"
str_id = str.object_id
str << " world"     # Mutates the string
str.upcase!         # Mutates the string
str.object_id == str_id  # => true

# Mutable array
arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr_id = arr.object_id
arr << 4            # Mutates the array
arr.push(5)         # Mutates the array
arr.object_id == arr_id  # => true

# Mutable hash
hash = { name: 'John' }
hash_id = hash.object_id
hash[:age] = 30     # Mutates the hash
hash.object_id == hash_id  # => true
```

**Note:** Strings in Ruby are mutable, unlike in Python where strings are immutable!
