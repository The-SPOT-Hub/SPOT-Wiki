## Problem 74: Things That Aren't Expressions

What are some things in Ruby that *aren't* expressions?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Very few things in Ruby aren't expressions. The main ones are certain keywords when used alone:

- `def` (by itself, though method definition as a whole returns a symbol)
- `class` (by itself)
- `module` (by itself)
- `return` (by itself, though it evaluates the expression after it)
- `begin`, `end`, `rescue`, `ensure` (keywords that structure expressions)

**But even these are part of structures that ARE expressions:**
```ruby
# Method definition returns a symbol
result = def my_method
           "hello"
         end
p result  # => :my_method

# Class definition returns nil
result = class MyClass
         end
p result  # => nil
```
