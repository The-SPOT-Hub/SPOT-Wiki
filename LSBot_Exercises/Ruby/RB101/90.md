## Problem 90: Method Calls and Short-Circuiting

What will be the output of the following code? Why?

```ruby
def foo
  p "foo was called"
end

def bar
  puts "bar was called"
end

result = foo && bar
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. What does `result` reference at the end of this snippet?
2. What happens if we change both methods to use `p` instead of `puts`?
3. What could we do if we wanted `result` to reference a *boolean* to indicate whether both methods have truthy return values?

**Output:**
```
"foo was called"
bar was called
```

**Explanation:**

1. `foo` is called first, which calls `p "foo was called"`:
   - `p` outputs the string with quotes: `"foo was called"`
   - `p` returns its argument: `"foo was called"`
2. Since `"foo was called"` is truthy, the `&&` continues to the second operand
3. `bar` is called, which calls `puts "bar was called"`:
   - `puts` outputs: `bar was called` (no quotes)
   - `puts` returns `nil`
4. `result` is assigned `nil` (the return value of `bar`, which is the second operand)

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: `result` references `nil` because:
- `foo` returns `"foo was called"` (truthy)
- `bar` returns `nil` (the return value of `puts`)
- `&&` returns the second operand when first is truthy
- So `result` gets `nil`

```ruby
p result  # => nil
```

**Bonus 2**: If both methods use `p`:

```ruby
def foo
  p "foo was called"  # Returns "foo was called"
end

def bar
  p "bar was called"  # Returns "bar was called"
end

result = foo && bar
```

Output:
```
"foo was called"
"bar was called"
```

Now `result` would reference `"bar was called"` instead of `nil`, because `p` returns its argument.

```ruby
p result  # => "bar was called"
```

**Bonus 3**: To get a boolean result:

```ruby
# Option 1: Use !!
result = !!(foo && bar)

# Option 2: Convert each to boolean
result = !!foo && !!bar

# Option 3: Use truthiness in a ternary
result = (foo && bar) ? true : false

# Option 4: Explicit boolean check
result = foo ? (bar ? true : false) : false
```

Example:
```ruby
def foo
  p "foo was called"
  "foo"
end

def bar
  puts "bar was called"
  nil
end

result = !!(foo && bar)
p result  # => false (because bar returns nil)
```
