## Problem 44: What is Flow Control?

What is **flow control**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Flow control refers to the order in which the Ruby interpreter executes statements in your program. It's how your program decides which path to take during execution.

Think of flow control as the path the Ruby interpreter takes through your code.

**Sequential execution** (default):
```ruby
puts "First"
puts "Second"
puts "Third"
# Executes line by line, top to bottom
```

**Conditional execution:**
```ruby
if temperature > 80
  puts "It's hot"
elsif temperature > 60
  puts "It's nice"
else
  puts "It's cold"
end
# Takes different paths based on conditions
```

**Looping:**
```ruby
counter = 0
loop do
  puts counter
  counter += 1
  break if counter == 3
end
# Repeats the same path multiple times
```

**Early termination:**
```ruby
def find_even(numbers)
  numbers.each do |num|
    return num if num.even?  # Exits early when found
  end
  nil
end
```

Flow control determines:
- Which code executes
- How many times code executes
- When execution stops
