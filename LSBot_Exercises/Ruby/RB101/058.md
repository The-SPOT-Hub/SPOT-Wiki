## Problem 58: Arrays with Immutable Elements

Is an array that contains *only* immutable elements still mutable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, an array is always mutable regardless of what it contains. Even if an array contains only immutable elements (like integers, symbols, booleans), the array itself can still be modifiedâ€”you can add, remove, or change elements.

**Distinction between mutating an array and mutating its elements:**

**Mutating the array:**
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]  # Contains only immutable integers
arr << 4         # Mutates the array
arr[0] = 10      # Mutates the array
arr.delete(2)    # Mutates the array
p arr  # => [10, 3, 4]
```

**Trying to mutate the elements (impossible with immutable types):**
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]
# We can't mutate the integers themselves:
arr[0] += 1  # This doesn't mutate the integer - it creates a new one and reassigns
```

**Example showing the difference:**
```ruby
# Array with strings (mutable elements)
arr1 = ["hello", "world"]
arr1[0] << "!"     # Mutates the element (string)
p arr1  # => ["hello!", "world"]

# Array with integers (immutable elements)
arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2[0] += 1       # Can't mutate the integer; creates new integer
p arr2  # => [2, 2, 3] (array mutated, but element replaced, not mutated)
```

**Operations that mutate the array but not the elements:**
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]
original_elements = arr.map(&:object_id)

arr << 4
arr.shift
arr[0] = 99

# The array changed, but we didn't mutate any integers
# (we just changed which integers the array points to)
```

**The immutability of the elements doesn't affect the mutability of the array itself.**
