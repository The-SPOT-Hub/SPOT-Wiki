## Problem 73: Is a Variable an Expression?

Is a variable an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, a variable is an expression. When you reference a variable, it evaluates to the object that the variable points to.

Examples:
```ruby
x = 5

# x is an expression that evaluates to 5
if x  # Evaluates to 5, which is truthy
  puts "x is truthy"
end

# Can use variables anywhere an expression is expected
y = x + 3      # x evaluates to 5
arr = [x, 10]  # x evaluates to 5
puts x         # x evaluates to 5
```

**Variables evaluate to their values:**
```ruby
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, #{name}!"  # name evaluates to "Alice"

arr = [1, 2, 3]
length = arr.length  # arr evaluates to the array object
```

**Using variable expressions:**
```ruby
x = 10
y = 20

# Variables in conditionals
if x > 5
  puts "Greater than 5"
end

# Variables in method calls
result = [x, y].max  # Both x and y are expressions

# Variables in expressions
sum = x + y  # x and y both evaluate to their values
```

**Assignment is also an expression:**
```ruby
# Assignment evaluates to the assigned value
if x = 10  # Assigns 10 to x, evaluates to 10 (truthy)
  puts "This runs"
end
```
