## Problem 86: Relying on Short-Circuiting

Should short-circuiting ever be relied upon, or is it something we must know about to avoid mistakes?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Short-circuiting can be relied upon for certain scenarios, such as when checking conditions before accessing an attribute or calling a method that might otherwise cause an exception. However, it should be used carefully and deliberately to ensure that the code remains readable and understandable.

**Good uses of short-circuiting:**

```ruby
# Avoiding NoMethodError:
user && user.email  # Only accesses email if user is not nil

# Avoiding division by zero:
denominator != 0 && numerator / denominator > 10

# Default values:
name = user_name || "Guest"  # Use "Guest" if user_name is falsy

# Chaining safe access:
order && order.customer && order.customer.email
```

**Examples where it's helpful:**

```ruby
# Without short-circuiting:
if user
  if user.email
    send_email(user.email)
  end
end

# With short-circuiting:
send_email(user.email) if user && user.email
```

**When to be cautious:**

```ruby
# This works but might be unclear:
result = condition && expensive_method || default_value

# This is clearer:
if condition && expensive_method
  result = expensive_method  # Note: now called twice!
else
  result = default_value
end

# Or better yet:
temp = expensive_method if condition
result = temp || default_value
```

**Ruby idioms that rely on short-circuiting:**

```ruby
# Common pattern for default values:
@name ||= "Default Name"  # Assign only if @name is falsy

# Safe navigation (Ruby 2.3+):
user&.email  # Same as: user && user.email

# Guard clauses:
return unless user
return if user.inactive?
```

Short-circuiting is a feature that can be relied upon when it improves code clarity and safety. Just ensure it's used intentionally.
