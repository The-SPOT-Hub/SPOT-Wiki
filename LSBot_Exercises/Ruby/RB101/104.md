## Problem 104: Do For Loops Take Blocks?

Do `for` loops take blocks?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, `for` loops do not take blocks. The syntax may look similar, but `for` loops use different syntax and have different scoping rules than blocks.

Examples:
```ruby
# for loop (NOT a block):
for i in [1, 2, 3]
  puts i
end

# each with block (IS a block):
[1, 2, 3].each do |i|
  puts i
end
```

**Key difference - variable scope:**
```ruby
# for loop - variable persists after loop:
for num in [1, 2, 3]
  squared = num * num
end

puts num      # => 3 (accessible!)
puts squared  # => 9 (accessible!)

# each with block - variable doesn't persist:
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  squared = num * num
end

# puts num      # NameError
# puts squared  # NameError
```

**Why this matters:**
```ruby
# for doesn't create a new scope:
outer = 10

for i in [1, 2, 3]
  outer = 20  # Reassigns outer variable
  inner = 30  # Creates variable accessible outside loop
end

puts outer  # => 20
puts inner  # => 30

# each creates an inner scope:
outer = 10

[1, 2, 3].each do |i|
  outer = 20  # Reassigns outer variable
  inner = 30  # Creates variable local to block
end

puts outer  # => 20
# puts inner  # NameError
```
