## Problem 75: Expressions in Conditionals

Can I use any expression in an `if` conditional, or only some?

Yes, you can use any expression in an `if` conditional. Ruby will evaluate the expression and check its truthiness.

The expression doesn't have to evaluate to a booleanâ€”it can evaluate to any object. Ruby will then check if that object is truthy or falsy.

Examples:
```ruby
# Comparison expression (evaluates to boolean):
if x > 5
  puts "Greater than 5"
end

# Arithmetic expression (evaluates to number):
if x + 10  # Truthy if result is not nil or false
  puts "Sum is truthy"
end

# String expression:
if "hello".upcase  # Evaluates to "HELLO", which is truthy
  puts "Truthy string"
end

# Method call expression:
if arr.length  # Evaluates to a number
  puts "Array has elements" if arr.length > 0
end

# Array literal:
if [1, 2, 3]  # Arrays are truthy
  puts "This runs"
end

# Variable:
if my_variable  # Evaluates to whatever my_variable references
  puts "Truthy"
end

# Assignment (be careful!):
if x = 10  # Assigns 10 to x, evaluates to 10 (truthy)
  puts "This runs, but might not be what you meant"
end

# Even 0 and empty strings work:
if 0  # Truthy in Ruby!
  puts "This runs"
end

if ""  # Truthy in Ruby!
  puts "This also runs"
end
```

**Only `nil` and `false` will cause the else branch:**
```ruby
if some_expression
  # Runs unless some_expression evaluates to nil or false
else
  # Runs only if some_expression is nil or false
end
```
