## Problem 71: What is an Expression?

What does it mean for something to be an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

An expression is any piece of code that evaluates to a value. In Ruby, almost everything is an expression - even things that might be statements in other languages.

Examples of expressions:
```ruby
5 + 3                    # Evaluates to 8
"hello".upcase           # Evaluates to "HELLO"
x > 10                   # Evaluates to true or false
[1, 2, 3]               # Evaluates to an array
arr.length              # Evaluates to a number
x = 5                   # Evaluates to 5 (assignment is an expression!)

# Even if statements are expressions:
result = if true
           42
         else
           0
         end
result  # => 42

# case statements are expressions:
grade = case score
        when 90..100 then 'A'
        when 80...90 then 'B'
        else 'F'
        end
```

**Everything returns a value:**
```ruby
# Method definitions return :method_name (as a symbol)
result = def my_method
           puts "hi"
         end
p result  # => :my_method

# Variable assignment returns the assigned value
x = (y = 10)
p x  # => 10
p y  # => 10
```
