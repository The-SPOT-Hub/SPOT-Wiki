## Problem 42: What is an Expression?

What is an **expression**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

An expression is any piece of code that evaluates to a value. In Ruby, almost everything is an expression.

Examples of expressions:
```ruby
5 + 3              # Evaluates to 8
"hello".upcase     # Evaluates to "HELLO"
x > 10             # Evaluates to true or false
[1, 2, 3]          # Evaluates to an array
x = 5              # Evaluates to 5 (assignment is an expression!)
if true
  10
else
  20
end                # Evaluates to 10
```

**Everything returns a value in Ruby:**
```ruby
# if statement is an expression
result = if 5 > 3
           "yes"
         else
           "no"
         end
result  # => "yes"

# case statement is an expression
grade = case score
        when 90..100 then 'A'
        when 80...90 then 'B'
        else 'F'
        end
```

**Using expression values:**
```ruby
# Can use any expression where a value is expected
puts 5 + 3                    # => 8
arr = [1, 2, 3].map { |n| n * 2 }
x = y = 10  # Both assignments are expressions
```
