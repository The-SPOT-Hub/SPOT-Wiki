## Problem 72: Is Everything an Expression?

Is everything in Ruby an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Almost everything in Ruby is an expression, but not quite everything:

- The `def` keyword itself (though the whole definition returns a symbol)
- The `class` keyword itself
- The `module` keyword itself
- Keywords like `begin`, `end`, `rescue` (though the whole block is an expression)

</details>
