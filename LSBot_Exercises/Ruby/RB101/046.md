## Problem 46: Conditionals and Return Values

Do conditionals always return booleans?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No! Conditionals don't return booleans - they evaluate based on truthiness and return the value of the branch that executes.

**Conditionals evaluate truthiness:**
```ruby
if "hello"  # String is truthy
  puts "This runs"
end

if 0  # Even 0 is truthy in Ruby!
  puts "This also runs"
end

if nil  # Only nil and false are falsy
  puts "This doesn't run"
end
```

**Conditionals return values:**
```ruby
# The conditional returns the value from the executed branch
result = if 5 > 3
           "yes"  # This branch executes
         else
           "no"
         end
result  # => "yes" (a string, not a boolean!)

# Another example
number = if true
           42
         else
           0
         end
number  # => 42 (an integer)

# Can be any type
data = if some_condition
         [1, 2, 3]  # Array
       else
         {a: 1}     # Hash
       end
```

**Using conditional return values:**
```ruby
status = case age
         when 0..12
           "child"
         when 13..19
           "teenager"
         else
           "adult"
         end
# status is a string, not a boolean
```

**In Ruby, only `nil` and `false` are falsy. Everything else is truthy!**
