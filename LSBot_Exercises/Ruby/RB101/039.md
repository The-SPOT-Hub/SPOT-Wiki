## Problem 39: What is a Literal?

What is a **literal**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A literal is notation that allows you to create an object directly in code by writing its value explicitly.

Examples of literals:
```ruby
5                  # Integer literal
3.14               # Float literal
"hello world"      # String literal
'hello world'      # String literal (single quotes)
true               # Boolean literal
false              # Boolean literal
nil                # Nil literal
:symbol            # Symbol literal
[1, 2, 3]          # Array literal
{name: 'John'}     # Hash literal
(1..10)            # Range literal
/pattern/          # Regex literal
```

Non-literal examples (these create objects but aren't literals):
```ruby
String.new("hello")      # Constructor, not a literal
Array.new([1, 2, 3])     # Constructor, not a literal
x = 5                    # Variable reference, not a literal
```
