## Problem 54: Multiple Variables, Same Object

Is it possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, it is possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object. When you assign one variable to another, both variables reference the same object in memory.

Examples:
```ruby
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = arr1  # Both arr1 and arr2 now point to the same array object

arr1.object_id == arr2.object_id  # => true
arr1.equal?(arr2)  # => true (same object)

# Mutating through one variable affects the other
arr1 << 4
p arr2  # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Variables with the same name in different scopes:**
```ruby
name = "Alice"  # Global scope

def greet
  name = "Bob"  # Local scope - different variable!
  puts name
end

greet  # => Bob
puts name  # => Alice

# These are different variables that happen to have the same name
```

**Multiple variables pointing to the same object:**
```ruby
str1 = "hello"
str2 = str1
str3 = str1

# All three point to the same object
str1.object_id == str2.object_id  # => true
str2.object_id == str3.object_id  # => true

# Mutating through any variable affects all
str1 << " world"
p str2  # => "hello world"
p str3  # => "hello world"
```
