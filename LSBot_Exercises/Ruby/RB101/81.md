## Problem 81: Regular vs Ternary Operators

What's the difference between a regular operator and a **ternary** operator?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The difference is in how many operands (values) they work with:

- **Unary operator**: Operates on one operand (e.g., `!`, `-` for negation, `not`)
- **Binary operator**: Operates on two operands (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&&`, `||`)
- **Ternary operator**: Operates on three operands (e.g., `condition ? true_value : false_value`)

**Examples:**

```ruby
# Unary operators (one operand):
!true          # 'not' operates on true
-5             # Negation operates on 5
+5             # Unary plus

# Binary operators (two operands):
5 + 3          # '+' operates on 5 and 3
10 - 2         # '-' operates on 10 and 2
x && y         # '&&' operates on x and y
"hello" + " world"  # '+' operates on two strings

# Ternary operator (three operands):
age >= 18 ? "adult" : "minor"
# Three parts: condition (age >= 18), true value ("adult"), false value ("minor")

score > 50 ? "pass" : "fail"
# condition (score > 50), true value ("pass"), false value ("fail")
```

**The ternary operator is Ruby's only ternary operator:**
```ruby
# General form:
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

# Examples:
status = age >= 18 ? "adult" : "minor"
max = a > b ? a : b
message = logged_in ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in"

# Can be nested (but be careful with readability):
grade = score >= 90 ? 'A' : score >= 80 ? 'B' : 'F'
```
