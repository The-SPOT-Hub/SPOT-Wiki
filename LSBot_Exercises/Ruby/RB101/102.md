## Problem 102: Accessing Block Variables from Outside

How can we access local variables that are defined *within* a block from *outside* of a block?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You cannot access variables that are initialized inside a block from outside the block. Variables created inside a block are local to that block.

However, blocks can reassign outer variables, and those changes persist after the block ends.

Examples:
```ruby
# Cannot access block-local variables:
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  doubled = num * 2
  puts doubled
end

# puts doubled  # NameError: undefined local variable

# Can reassign outer variables:
total = 0

[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  total += num  # Reassigns outer variable
end

puts total  # => 6 (accessible because it was defined outside)
```

**Variable shadowing in blocks:**
```ruby
num = 10

[1, 2, 3].each do |num|  # Parameter shadows outer num
  puts num  # References block parameter, not outer num
end

puts num  # => 10 (outer num unchanged)
```

**Block parameters are local to the block:**
```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end

# puts num  # NameError: block parameter doesn't exist outside
```

**Initialization vs reassignment:**
```ruby
# Initialization in block - creates block-local variable:
[1].each do |n|
  new_var = 100  # Initialized in block
end
# puts new_var  # NameError

# Reassignment of outer variable:
existing_var = 0
[1].each do |n|
  existing_var = 100  # Reassigns outer variable
end
puts existing_var  # => 100 (accessible)
```
