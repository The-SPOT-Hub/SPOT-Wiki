## Problem 67: Truthy vs True

Is `truthy` an object? Is `true` an object?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Truthy is not an object. `true` is an object of type `TrueClass`.

"Truthy" is a concept or descriptionâ€”it describes objects that evaluate to `true` in a boolean context. `true` is an actual boolean object.

Examples:
```ruby
# "hello" is truthy (it evaluates to true in boolean context)
# but "hello" is not the same as true
if "hello"  # This works because "hello" is truthy
  puts "Truthy!"
end

puts "hello" == true   # => false - "hello" is not true, just truthy
puts !!("hello")       # => true - when converted to boolean, it becomes true

# true is an actual object
puts true.class        # => TrueClass
puts true.is_a?(Object)  # => true

# "truthy" is just a term
# puts truthy  # => NameError
```

**Truthiness vs actual boolean:**
```ruby
value = "hello"

# Is it truthy? Yes
if value
  puts "It's truthy"  # This runs
end

# Is it true? No
if value == true
  puts "It's true"  # This doesn't run
end

# Converting to boolean
puts value.class  # => String
puts (!!value).class  # => TrueClass
```
