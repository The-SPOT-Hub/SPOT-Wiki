## Problem 88: Operators or Flow Control?

Are `&&` and `||` operators or flow control?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

`&&` and `||` are logical **operators**. However, they can act similarly to flow control because they determine whether the second operand is evaluated based on the result of the first operand (short-circuiting).

**Important note:** In Ruby, `&&` and `||` are true operators, not methods. This is different from some operators like `+` which are actually method calls.

Examples:
```ruby
# Acting as operators (return values):
result = true && false   # => false
result = true || false   # => true
result = 5 && 10        # => 10

# Acting like flow control (short-circuiting):
true || expensive_method    # expensive_method never runs
false && expensive_method   # expensive_method never runs

# Demonstrating they're operators, not methods:
5.+(3)         # Works - + is a method
# 5.&&(3)      # Error! && is not a method, it's an operator
```

**Operators vs Methods:**

```ruby
# These are method calls:
5 + 3          # Equivalent to: 5.+(3)
"hi" + " there"  # Equivalent to: "hi".+(" there")

# These are operators (not methods):
5 && 3         # Pure operator, no method equivalent
true || false  # Pure operator, no method equivalent
```

**Flow control aspect:**

```ruby
def side_effect
  puts "Function called!"
  true
end

# && controls whether side_effect runs:
false && side_effect  # "Function called!" never prints
true && side_effect   # "Function called!" prints

# || controls whether side_effect runs:
true || side_effect   # "Function called!" never prints
false || side_effect  # "Function called!" prints
```

**Comparison with if statements:**

Unlike `if` statements (pure flow control), `&&` and `||` are expressions that return values while also controlling execution flow through short-circuiting.

```ruby
# if is flow control (returns value but primarily controls flow)
if condition
  do_something
end

# && is an operator that has flow control characteristics
result = condition && do_something
```
