## Problem 85: Short-Circuiting Operators

What operators can lead to short-circuiting?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `&&` and `||` logical operators can lead to short-circuiting.

- For `&&`: If the first operand is falsy, the second operand is not evaluated
- For `||`: If the first operand is truthy, the second operand is not evaluated

Examples:
```ruby
# Short-circuiting with &&:
result = false && puts("This won't print")  # puts is never called

result = nil && expensive_method()  # expensive_method is never called

# Short-circuiting with ||:
result = true || puts("This won't print")  # puts is never called

result = "hello" || expensive_method()  # expensive_method is never called

# When short-circuit doesn't happen:
result = true && puts("This WILL print")   # puts is called
result = false || puts("This WILL print")  # puts is called
```

**Practical use:**
```ruby
# Avoid errors with &&:
user && user.name  # Only calls .name if user is not nil

# Default values with ||:
name = user_input || "Guest"  # Use "Guest" if user_input is falsy
```

**Collection methods that short-circuit:**

Some collection methods are also implemented to short-circuit:

```ruby
# any? stops at the first truthy value:
[false, false, true, false].any? { |val| val }  # Stops at true

# all? stops at the first falsy value:
[true, true, false, true].all? { |val| val }  # Stops at false

# find stops at the first match:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].find { |n| n > 3 }  # Stops at 4, doesn't check 5
```

**Note about `and` and `or`:**

Ruby also has `and` and `or` keywords (different from `&&` and `||`):
```ruby
# These also short-circuit but have lower precedence
result = true or false  # Same behavior as ||
result = true and false  # Same behavior as &&
```
