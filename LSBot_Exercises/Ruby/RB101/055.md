## Problem 55: Variables Referencing Variables

Can variables reference other variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, variables cannot reference other variables directly. Variables are names that point to objects in memory. When you assign one variable to another, you're making both variables point to the same object, not making one variable point to the other variable.

Examples:
```ruby
a = 5
b = a  # b points to the same object (5) that a points to, not to variable a itself

a = 10  # a now points to a different object
p a  # => 10
p b  # => 5 (b still points to the original 5)
```

**Visualization:**
```ruby
x = "hello"
y = x

# This creates:
# x --> "hello" <-- y
# NOT: x --> y --> "hello"

x = "goodbye"
# Now:
# x --> "goodbye"
# y --> "hello"
```

**With mutable objects:**
```ruby
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = arr1  # Both point to the same array

arr1 << 4
p arr2  # => [1, 2, 3, 4] (sees the change because it points to the same object)

arr1 = [5, 6, 7]  # arr1 reassigned to new array
p arr2  # => [1, 2, 3, 4] (still points to original array)
```
