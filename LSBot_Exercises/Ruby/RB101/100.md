## Problem 100: What is a Block?

What is a block?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method and executed within that method's context. Blocks are not objects themselves (though they can be converted to Proc objects).

**Block syntax:**

Blocks can be written in two ways:

1. **Curly braces** `{ }` - typically for single-line blocks
2. **do...end** - typically for multi-line blocks

Examples:
```ruby
# Single-line block with curly braces:
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }

# Multi-line block with do...end:
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  squared = num * num
  puts squared
end

# Can use either for single line:
5.times { puts "Hello" }
5.times do puts "Hello" end

# Can use either for multiple lines (but do...end is conventional):
[1, 2, 3].map { |n|
  n * 2
}

[1, 2, 3].map do |n|
  n * 2
end
```

**Blocks are passed to methods:**
```ruby
# The method 'each' takes a block
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end

# The method 'map' takes a block
[1, 2, 3].map { |n| n * 2 }

# The method 'times' takes a block
3.times { puts "Hi" }
```

**Blocks have access to outer scope:**
```ruby
multiplier = 2
[1, 2, 3].map { |n| n * multiplier }  # Can access multiplier
```
