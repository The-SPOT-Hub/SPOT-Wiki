## Problem 98: Reassigning Outer Variables in Methods

Can we reassign variables from the outer scope from within a method definition?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, you cannot reassign local variables from the outer scope from within a method definition. Methods have their own isolated scope and cannot access outer local variables at all.

However, you can:
- Return a value and reassign it in the outer scope
- Use global variables (not recommended)
- Mutate objects passed as arguments (if they're mutable)

Examples:
```ruby
# This does NOT work:
outer_var = 10

def try_to_change
  outer_var = 20  # Creates a NEW local variable in the method
end

try_to_change
puts outer_var  # => 10 (unchanged)

# This DOES work - using return value:
outer_var = 10

def change_value(var)
  var * 2
end

outer_var = change_value(outer_var)  # Reassign with return value
puts outer_var  # => 20

# This DOES work - using global variables (not recommended):
$global_var = 10

def change_global
  $global_var = 20
end

change_global
puts $global_var  # => 20
```

**Contrast with blocks:**
```ruby
# Blocks CAN reassign outer variables:
outer_var = 10

[1].each do |num|
  outer_var = 20  # Reassigns the outer variable
end

puts outer_var  # => 20

# Methods CANNOT:
outer_var = 10

def my_method
  outer_var = 20  # Creates new local variable
end

my_method
puts outer_var  # => 10 (unchanged)
```
