## Problem 40: What is a Method?

What is a **method**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

A method is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task. Methods can accept input (arguments), perform operations, and return a value.

**Difference between method, block, and main scope code:**

**Method:**
```ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greet("Alice")  # => "Hello, Alice!"
```

**Block:**
```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
```

**Main scope code:**
```ruby
# Code written at the top level, not inside a method or block
puts "This is main scope"
x = 5
```

**Key differences:**
- Methods are defined with `def` and can be called multiple times
- Blocks are passed to methods and executed within their context
- Main scope code executes immediately when the file runs

```ruby
# Method - reusable, defined once, called many times
def double(num)
  num * 2
end

# Block - passed to another method, executed in that context
[1, 2, 3].map { |num| num * 2 }

# Main scope - runs immediately
result = double(5)
puts result
```
