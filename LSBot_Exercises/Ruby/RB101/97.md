## Problem 97: Accessing Method Variables from Outside

How can we access local variables that are defined *within* a method definition from *outside* of a method definition?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You cannot. Use return values if you need to get data out of a method.

Variables defined inside a method are local to that method and are destroyed when the method returns. The only way to get data out of a method is through return values.

Examples:
```ruby
def my_method
  local_var = 42
  local_var
end

result = my_method
puts result  # => 42

# puts local_var  # NameError: undefined local variable

# Returning multiple values:
def calculate_stats
  total = 100
  average = 50
  [total, average]  # Return as array
end

total, avg = calculate_stats
puts total  # => 100
puts avg    # => 50

# Using a hash to return named values:
def get_user_info
  name = "Alice"
  age = 30
  { name: name, age: age }
end

user = get_user_info
puts user[:name]  # => Alice
```

**Why this design:**
```ruby
# Each method call has its own local variables:
def process
  data = [1, 2, 3]
  data
end

result1 = process
result2 = process

# result1 and result2 get copies of the return value
# The local 'data' variable is created and destroyed each time
```
