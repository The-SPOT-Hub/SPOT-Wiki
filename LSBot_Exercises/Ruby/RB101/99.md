## Problem 99: Mutating Objects from Within Methods

Can we mutate values referenced by variables outside of a method from within a method?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes! If you pass a mutable object to a method as an argument, you can mutate that object from within the method.

The method receives a reference to the same object, so mutations affect the original.

Examples:
```ruby
# Mutating an array:
def add_element(arr)
  arr << 4
end

my_array = [1, 2, 3]
add_element(my_array)
p my_array  # => [1, 2, 3, 4] (mutated!)

# Mutating a string:
def append_text(str)
  str << " world"
end

my_string = "hello"
append_text(my_string)
p my_string  # => "hello world" (mutated!)

# Mutating a hash:
def add_key(hash)
  hash[:new_key] = "value"
end

my_hash = { a: 1 }
add_key(my_hash)
p my_hash  # => {:a=>1, :new_key=>"value"} (mutated!)
```

**Cannot mutate immutable objects:**
```ruby
# Integers are immutable:
def try_to_change(num)
  num += 10  # Only reassigns the local parameter
end

number = 5
try_to_change(number)
p number  # => 5 (unchanged)
```

**Key understanding:**
```ruby
# The method doesn't access the outer variable
# It accesses the object through its parameter

outer_arr = [1, 2, 3]

def modify(arr)  # 'arr' is not the same variable as 'outer_arr'
  # But 'arr' and 'outer_arr' point to the same array object
  arr << 4  # Mutates the shared object
end

modify(outer_arr)
p outer_arr  # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
