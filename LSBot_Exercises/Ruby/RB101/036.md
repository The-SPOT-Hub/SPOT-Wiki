## Problem 36: Immutable Types in Ruby

What are the **immutable types** in Ruby?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The immutable types in Ruby are:
- Integer (e.g., `42`, `-5`)
- Float (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`)
- `true`
- `false`
- `nil`
- Symbol (e.g., `:name`, `:status`)

These types cannot be modified once created. Any operation that appears to modify them actually creates a new object.

Examples:
```ruby
num = 5
num.object_id  # => some number
num += 1       # Creates new integer
num.object_id  # => different number

sym = :hello
sym.object_id  # => some number
# No way to mutate a symbol
```
