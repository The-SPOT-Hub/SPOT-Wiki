## Problem 56: Arrays Containing Variables

Can I create an array that contains variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, arrays don't contain variables themselves. When you create an array with variables, the array contains references to the objects that those variables point to, not the variables themselves.

Examples:
```ruby
x = 5
y = 10
my_arr = [x, y]  # Array contains the objects 5 and 10, not the variables x and y

x = 20  # Changing x doesn't affect the array
p my_arr  # => [5, 10]
```

**Demonstration:**
```ruby
name = "Alice"
age = 30
data = [name, age]

name = "Bob"  # Reassigning name
age = 35      # Reassigning age

p data  # => ["Alice", 30] (array unchanged)
```

**With mutable objects:**
```ruby
str = "hello"
arr = [str]

# If we mutate the object that str points to:
str << " world"
p arr  # => ["hello world"] (array sees the change)

# But if we reassign str:
str = "goodbye"
p arr  # => ["hello world"] (array still has reference to original object)
```

**What arrays actually contain:**
```ruby
x = "hello"
arr = [x]

# The array contains a reference to the same object x points to
arr[0].object_id == x.object_id  # => true (before reassignment)

x = "goodbye"  # Reassignment
arr[0].object_id == x.object_id  # => false (x points to different object now)
```
