## Problem 66: Is Every Object Truthy or Falsy?

Is *every* object either truthy or falsy?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, every **object** in Ruby is either truthy or falsy.

Every object in Ruby can be evaluated in a boolean context (like in an `if` statement), and it will be considered either truthy or falsy. There is no object that doesn't have truthiness.

**In Ruby, only `nil` and `false` are falsy. Everything else is truthy!**

Examples:
```ruby
if 42  # Truthy
  puts "This runs"
end

if 0  # Truthy in Ruby! (unlike some other languages)
  puts "This also runs"
end

if ""  # Truthy in Ruby! (unlike some other languages)
  puts "Even empty strings are truthy"
end

if []  # Truthy in Ruby!
  puts "Empty arrays are truthy"
end

if nil  # Falsy
  puts "This doesn't run"
end

if false  # Falsy
  puts "This doesn't run"
end
```

**Only two falsy values:**
```ruby
# Falsy:
nil
false

# Everything else is truthy:
0, "", [], {}, 0.0, -1, "false", "nil"
```
