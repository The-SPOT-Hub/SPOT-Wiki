## Problem 48: Truthiness and Flow Control

What will be output by this code and why?

```ruby
value1 = (3 < 2)
value2 = (6 % 2 == 0)
value3 = ('Ruby' == 'ruby')
  
if value1
  puts "It must be value1"
elsif value2 && value3
  puts "It must be value2 and value3"
end
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Do `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` reference expressions?
2. Would it ever be possible for both of these calls to `puts` to be executed? (i.e., if `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` were all truthy?)
3. Are there any return values in this code? If so, what are they?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Output:** Nothing is output.

**Why:**
- `value1` is `false` because `3 < 2` is false
- `value2` is `true` because `6 % 2 == 0` (6 is even)
- `value3` is `false` because `'Ruby' == 'ruby'` is false (case-sensitive)

The `if` branch doesn't execute because `value1` is `false`. The `elsif` branch doesn't execute because `value2 && value3` evaluates to `false` (both must be truthy, but `value3` is false).

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: No, `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` don't reference expressions - they reference the **values** that the expressions evaluated to. When we initialized them, we evaluated the expressions on the right side of `=`.

```ruby
value1 = (3 < 2)  # The expression (3 < 2) evaluates, then value1 holds false
```

**Bonus 2**: No, it would never be possible for both `puts` to execute. `if/elsif` structures can only execute one branch - they're mutually exclusive.

**Bonus 3**: Yes! The entire `if` statement has a return value. You can verify this with `p`:

```ruby
result = if value1
           puts "It must be value1"
         elsif value2 && value3
           puts "It must be value2 and value3"
         end

p result  # => nil (because no branch executed)
```

If a branch executes, the return value is the value of the last expression in that branch:
```ruby
result = if true
           "yes"
         else
           "no"
         end
p result  # => "yes"
```
