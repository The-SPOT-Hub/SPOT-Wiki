## Problem 53: What is Reassignment?

What does it mean to **reassign** a variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

To reassign a variable means to change what object the variable points to. When you reassign a variable, you're making it reference a different value or object in memory.

Examples:
```ruby
x = 5          # x points to the integer 5
x = 10         # x is reassigned to point to the integer 10

name = "Alice"
name = "Bob"   # name now points to a different string

arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr = [4, 5, 6]  # arr now points to a different array
```

**Reassignment creates a new binding:**
```ruby
str = "hello"
original_id = str.object_id

str = "goodbye"  # Reassignment
str.object_id == original_id  # => false (different object)
```

**Reassignment vs Mutation:**
```ruby
# Reassignment - points to new object
x = "hello"
x = "world"  # x now points to a different string

# Mutation - modifies the same object
x = "hello"
x << " world"  # x still points to the same string, but modified
```
