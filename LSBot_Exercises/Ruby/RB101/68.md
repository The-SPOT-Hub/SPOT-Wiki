## Problem 68: Things Without Truthiness

What are some things in Ruby that *don't* have truthiness?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

In Ruby, almost everything that can be evaluated is an object, and all objects have truthiness.

However, some **language constructs** that aren't objects don't have truthiness:
- Keywords like `def`, `class`, `module`, `if`, `unless`, `while`, `until`
- These are not expressions and cannot be evaluated for truthiness

Examples:
```ruby
# You can't do this:
# if (if x > 5)  # SyntaxError! 'if' is not an expression

# But you can do this:
result = if x > 5  # 'if' returns a value, but the 'if' keyword itself has no truthiness
           "yes"
         else
           "no"
         end

if result  # The result is an object with truthiness
  puts "Truthy"
end
```

</details>
