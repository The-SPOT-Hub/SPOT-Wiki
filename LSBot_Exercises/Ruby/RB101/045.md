## Problem 45: Flow Control Tools in Ruby

What are some different tools we have in Ruby for flow control?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Ruby provides several tools for controlling program flow:

**Conditionals:**
```ruby
# if/elsif/else
if condition
  # do something
elsif other_condition
  # do something else
else
  # default action
end

# unless
unless condition
  # do something
end

# Ternary operator
result = condition ? "true value" : "false value"

# case/when
case value
when 1
  "one"
when 2
  "two"
else
  "other"
end
```

**Loops:**
```ruby
# loop
loop do
  # repeats forever unless broken
  break if condition
end

# while
while condition
  # repeats while condition is true
end

# until
until condition
  # repeats until condition is true
end

# for
for i in 1..5
  # iterates over range
end
```

**Iterators:**
```ruby
# each
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }

# times
5.times { puts "Hello" }

# map, select, etc.
```

**Loop control:**
```ruby
# break - exits the loop
# next - skips to next iteration
# return - exits the method
```

**Difference between `loop` and `while`:**

`loop`:
```ruby
loop do
  # Infinite loop
  break if condition  # Must use break to exit
end
```

`while`:
```ruby
while condition
  # Repeats while condition is true
  # Exits automatically when condition becomes false
end
```

The path the Ruby interpreter takes depends on which tool you use and the conditions you set.
