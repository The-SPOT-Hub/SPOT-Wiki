## Problem 101: Accessing Outside Variables in Blocks

How can we access local variables that are defined *outside* of a block from *within* a block?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

You can access them directly! Blocks have access to variables from the outer scope.

This is one of the key differences between blocks and methods - blocks can see and use variables from the surrounding scope.

Examples:
```ruby
# Accessing outer variable:
outer_var = 10
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts outer_var + num  # Can access outer_var
end

# Reassigning outer variable:
total = 0
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  total += num  # Reassigns outer variable
end
puts total  # => 6

# Using multiple outer variables:
multiplier = 2
threshold = 5

[1, 2, 3, 6, 7].select do |num|
  num * multiplier > threshold  # Uses both outer variables
end
# => [3, 6, 7]
```

**Blocks create an inner scope:**
```ruby
x = 10

[1].each do |num|
  x = 20     # Reassigns outer x
  y = 30     # Creates new variable in block scope
  puts x     # => 20
  puts y     # => 30
end

puts x  # => 20 (outer x was reassigned)
# puts y  # NameError (y is local to block)
```

**Nested blocks:**
```ruby
x = 1

[1].each do |a|
  x = 2
  [1].each do |b|
    x = 3  # Reassigns the outermost x
    puts x
  end
  puts x  # => 3
end

puts x  # => 3
```
