## Problem 59: Working with Immutable Types

If we can't mutate some data types, like integers, then how can we use them? We can't type out all of the numbers we need, so how do we work with immutable data types?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

We work with immutable data types through **reassignment** and **creating new objects**. When you perform operations on immutable types, Ruby creates new objects rather than modifying the existing ones.

Examples:
```ruby
x = 5
x = x + 3  # Creates a new integer object (8) and reassigns x to point to it

name = "frozen".freeze  # Make string immutable
name = name.upcase     # Creates a new string "FROZEN" and reassigns name
```

**How reassignment works:**
```ruby
count = 0
original_id = count.object_id

count = count + 1  # Creates new integer 1
count.object_id == original_id  # => false (different object)

count += 1  # Shorthand for count = count + 1
# Still creates a new object
```

**Operations create new objects:**
```ruby
num = 10
result = num * 2     # Creates new integer 20
another = num + 5    # Creates new integer 15
p num  # => 10 (original unchanged)
```

**Using immutable values in computations:**
```ruby
def calculate_total(prices)
  total = 0  # Start with immutable integer
  prices.each do |price|
    total = total + price  # Create new integer each time
  end
  total
end

calculate_total([10, 20, 30])  # => 60
```

**This works perfectly fine because:**
1. Variables can be reassigned to point to new objects
2. New objects are created as needed
3. Immutability just means the original object doesn't change

**Symbols (immutable) example:**
```ruby
status = :pending
status = :approved  # Reassignment to different symbol
# Can't mutate a symbol, but can reassign the variable
```
