## Problem 105: False Blocks

What other 'false' blocks do we have? Things that look like blocks, but aren't?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Several Ruby constructs look like blocks but aren't actually blocks:

**1. `for` loops:**
```ruby
for i in [1, 2, 3]
  puts i
end
# Looks like a block, but isn't - doesn't create new scope
```

**2. Method definitions:**
```ruby
def my_method
  puts "hi"
end
# Uses do...end or similar structure, but not a block
```
