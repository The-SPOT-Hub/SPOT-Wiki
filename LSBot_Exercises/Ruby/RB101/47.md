## Problem 47: Assignment vs Equality

What's the difference between `=` and `==`?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

`=` is the **assignment operator** - it assigns a value to a variable.

`==` is the **equality operator** - it compares two values and returns `true` or `false`.

Examples:
```ruby
# = (assignment)
x = 5        # Assigns 5 to x
name = "Bob" # Assigns "Bob" to name

# == (equality comparison)
x == 5       # => true (checks if x equals 5)
x == 10      # => false
name == "Bob"  # => true
```

**Assignment as an expression:**
```ruby
# Assignment returns the assigned value
x = (y = 10)  # y gets 10, then x gets 10
puts x  # => 10
puts y  # => 10
```

**Common mistakes:**
```ruby
# Wrong - using = in a conditional
if x = 5  # This assigns 5 to x, then checks if 5 is truthy (it is!)
  puts "This always runs!"
end

# Correct - using == in a conditional
if x == 5  # This checks if x equals 5
  puts "x is 5"
end
```

**Other comparison operators:**
```ruby
!=   # Not equal
<    # Less than
>    # Greater than
<=   # Less than or equal
>=   # Greater than or equal
===  # Case equality (used in case statements)
```
