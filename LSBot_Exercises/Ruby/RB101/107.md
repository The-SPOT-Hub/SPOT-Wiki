## Problem 107: Nested Block Scopes

What happens when we run this code? Why?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
number_enthusiast = 'Lisa Simpson'
  
numbers.each do |num|
  loop do
    sentence = number_enthusiast + " loves the number #{num}!"
    puts sentence
    break
  end
  puts sentence
end
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Assuming we'd like to see each sentence printed *twice* for each number in `numbers`, how can we fix this code? Do not change the second call to `puts`.
2. What happens if we comment out `break` in the original code? Why?
3. How many scopes are there in this snippet, and what variables are available in each?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**What happens:**

This code will raise a `NameError` on line 10.

**Output:**
```
Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
NameError: undefined local variable or method `sentence'
```

**Why:**

The variable `sentence` is initialized inside the `loop` block (line 6), making it local to that inner block. When we try to access `sentence` outside the loop on line 10, it doesn't exist in the `each` block's scope.

**Bonus Answers:**

**Bonus 1**: Initialize `sentence` before the loop:

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
number_enthusiast = 'Lisa Simpson'
  
numbers.each do |num|
  sentence = nil  # Initialize in outer block scope
  
  loop do
    sentence = number_enthusiast + " loves the number #{num}!"
    puts sentence
    break
  end
  puts sentence  # Now accessible!
end

# Output:
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 2!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 2!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 3!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 3!
```

**Bonus 2**: If we comment out `break`, we get an infinite loop:

```ruby
numbers.each do |num|
  loop do
    sentence = number_enthusiast + " loves the number #{num}!"
    puts sentence
    # break  # Commented out
  end
  puts sentence
end

# Output:
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
# Lisa Simpson loves the number 1!
# ... (infinite loop, never gets to line 10)
```

The `loop` method creates an infinite loop unless you explicitly `break` out of it.

**Bonus 3**: Three scopes exist:

**Scope 1: Outer/main scope**
- Variables: `numbers`, `number_enthusiast`
- Can access: only outer scope variables

**Scope 2: `each` block scope**
- Variables: `num` (parameter), inherits `numbers` and `number_enthusiast`
- Can access: outer scope variables + `num`
- Cannot access: `sentence` (it's in the inner loop)

**Scope 3: `loop` block scope**
- Variables: `sentence` (initialized here), inherits all from `each` block
- Can access: outer scope variables + `num` + `sentence`

**Visualization:**
```
Main scope: numbers, number_enthusiast
  └─ each block: num
      └─ loop block: sentence
```

Variables flow inward but not outward.
