## Problem 6

Follow the instructions below. This problem is designed to teach you to think laterally. This problem does have a solution. If it doesn't make sense, that's because the problems are designed to force you to think differently about the implementation of the object oriented concepts that you have learned.  

```ruby
# Without adding any methods below, implement a solution; originally by Natalie Thompson, 
# this version by Oscar Cortes

class ClassA 
  attr_reader :field1, :field2
  
  def initialize(num)
    @field1 = "xyz"
    @field2 = num
  end
end

class ClassB 
  attr_reader :field1

  def initialize
    @field1 = "abc"
  end
end

obj1 = ClassA.new(50)
obj2 = ClassA.new(25)
obj3 = ClassB.new

p obj1 > obj2
p obj2 > obj3
```
