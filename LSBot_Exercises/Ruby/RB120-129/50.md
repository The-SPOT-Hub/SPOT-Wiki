## Problem 50

If we use `==` to compare the individual `Cat` objects in the code above, will the return value be `true`? Why or why not? What does this demonstrate about classes and objects in Ruby, as well as the `==` method?

```ruby
class Cat
end

whiskers = Cat.new
ginger = Cat.new
paws = Cat.new
```
