## Problem 4

Follow the instructions below. This problem is designed to teach you to think laterally. This problem does have a solution. If it doesn't make sense, that's because the problems are designed to force you to think differently about the implementation of the object oriented concepts that you have learned.  

```ruby
# Describe what the code below outputs and why - from Joseph Ochoa.

module Attackable
  def attack
    "attacks!"
  end
end

class Characters
  attr_accessor :name, :characters 
  
  def initialize(name) 
    #
    self.name 
    @characters = [] 
  end
  
  def display
    name
  end
  
  protected 
  attr_reader :name
  attr_writer :name
end

class Monster < Characters
  include Attackable
  
  def initialize(name)
    super
  end
end

class Barbarian < Characters
  def ==(other)
    if(super.self == super.self) # 
      super.self == super.self
    end
  end
end

conan = Barbarian.new('barb') 
rob = Monster.new('monst')
conan.characters << rob
p conan.display
```
