# Problem received from Raul Romero

class Human 
    attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name="Dylan")
    @name = name
  end
  
end

puts Human.new("Jo").hair_colour("blonde")  
# Should output "Hi, my name is Jo and I have blonde hair."

puts Human.hair_colour("")              
# Should "Hi, my name is Dylan and I have blonde hair."
```
