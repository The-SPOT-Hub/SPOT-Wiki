## Problem 5

Follow the instructions below. This problem is designed to teach you to think laterally. This problem does have a solution. If it doesn't make sense, that's because the problems are designed to force you to think differently about the implementation of the object oriented concepts that you have learned.

```ruby
# From Joseph Ochoa
# give class Barbarian the functionality of the Monster instance attack method:
  # If you used class inheritance, now try doing it without class inheritance directly.
  # If you used modules, now try not using modules
  # If you used duck typing, now don't use duck typing 

class Monster
  def attack
    "attacks!"
  end
end

class Barbarian
  
end
```
