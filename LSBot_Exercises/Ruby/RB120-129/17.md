## Problem 17

What is output and why? What does this demonstrate about `super`?

```ruby
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
  def initialize(color)
    super
    @color = color
  end
end

bruno = GoodDog.new("brown")       
p bruno
```
