<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Teams**
- `GET /teams` — list teams
- `GET /teams/new` — form
- `POST /teams` — create
- `GET /teams/:id` — show
- `GET /teams/:id/edit` — edit form
- `POST /teams/:id` — update (or PATCH/PUT)
- `POST /teams/:id/delete` — delete

**Members (nested)**
- `POST /teams/:team_id/members` — add
- `POST /teams/:team_id/members/:id/delete` — remove
- `POST /teams/:team_id/members/:id` — update (or PATCH/PUT)

</details>
