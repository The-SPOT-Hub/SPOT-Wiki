## Problem 8: Sessions Not Persisting

You push to Heroku and find that session data isn't persisting between requests. What's one common Sinatra configuration you might be missing locally that will also affect production? Provide the fix.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- Missing session support. You must enable sessions.

- Fix:
```ruby
require "sinatra"
enable :sessions
# Optionally set a session secret in production
set :session_secret, ENV.fetch("SESSION_SECRET", "dev-secret")
```
