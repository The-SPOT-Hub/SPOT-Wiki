## Problem 6: Preventing Survey Response Collisions

A survey app writes all responses to `responses.txt`, and simultaneous submissions overwrite each other. How can storing responses "in files based on the current time" help, and what filename pattern could you use?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

- Use a unique filename per submission (timestamp + random suffix) to avoid write collisions.

- Example pattern: `responses/2025-10-22T15-30-12-123456_abcdef.json`
