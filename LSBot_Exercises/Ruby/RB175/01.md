For a simple contact list app, when would you store data in the session vs in files? Give one trade-off for each.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

- **Session**: Good for prototypes or per-user temporary data. Trade-off: data is lost when the session expires; not shared across users.

- **Files**: Good for persisting across restarts and sharing data between users. Trade-off: you must handle file I/O, formats, and potential write conflicts.
