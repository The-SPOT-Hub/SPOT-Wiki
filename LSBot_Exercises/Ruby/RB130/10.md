## Problem 10: Bundler and Gem Management

What is the primary role of Bundler in a Ruby project? Explain the purpose of the `Gemfile` and the `Gemfile.lock`.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The primary role of Bundler is to manage a Ruby application's gem dependencies. It ensures that a project uses the exact versions of gems it requires, creating a consistent and reproducible environment for all developers on a project.

- **`Gemfile`**: This is a file where a developer explicitly lists the gems the project depends on. You can specify version constraints, such as requiring an exact version (`'1.2.3'`), a minimum version (`'>= 1.2'`), or an optimistic version (`'~> 1.2'`).

- **`Gemfile.lock`**: This file is automatically generated by Bundler after it successfully resolves all dependencies from the `Gemfile`. It contains a snapshot of the exact versions of every gem and sub-dependency that was installed. When another developer runs `bundle install`, Bundler uses this lockfile to install the exact same versions, preventing inconsistencies and "works on my machine" issues. The `Gemfile.lock` should be committed to version control.
