## Problem 1: Understanding Closures

What is a closure in Ruby? Explain how closures relate to blocks and variable scope. Provide a simple code example to illustrate your explanation.

<summary>Solution:</summary>

A closure is a procedure (like a block, proc, or lambda) that "closes over" or remembers the environment in which it was created. This means it has access to the local variables that were in scope when the closure was defined, even if the closure is executed in a completely different scope. This concept is central to how blocks can interact with variables outside of their own definition.

```ruby
def counter
  count = 0
  -> { count += 1 } # This lambda is a closure; it "closes over" the `count` variable
end

c1 = counter
puts c1.call # => 1
puts c1.call # => 2

# The lambda remembers and can modify the `count` variable from the `counter` method's
# scope, even after the `counter` method has finished executing.
```
