## Problem 7: Symbol#to_proc

Explain what the `&:symbol` syntax does in Ruby. Provide a code example that shows how it can be used to simplify code.

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `&:symbol` syntax is a shortcut that converts a symbol into a proc. When this proc is passed to an enumerable method (like `map` or `select`), it calls the method named by the symbol on each element of the collection. It is shorthand for `{ |item| item.symbol }`.

For example, `&:upcase` is equivalent to `{ |str| str.upcase }`.

**Example:**

```ruby
words = ["hello", "world", "ruby"]

# The standard block syntax
capitalized_words_block = words.map { |word| word.capitalize }
p capitalized_words_block # => ["Hello", "World", "Ruby"]

# Using the Symbol#to_proc shortcut
capitalized_words_proc = words.map(&:capitalize)
p capitalized_words_proc # => ["Hello", "World", "Ruby"]
```
