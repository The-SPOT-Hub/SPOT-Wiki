## Problem 8: Explicit Block Parameter Bug

This `wrapper` method is intended to execute a block passed to it. However, calling it results in an `ArgumentError`. Find and fix the bug.

```ruby
def wrapper(block)
  puts "Executing block now..."
  block.call
  puts "Block execution finished."
end

wrapper { puts "This is inside the block." } # Raises ArgumentError
```

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The bug is in the method definition `def wrapper(block)`. In Ruby, a block is not passed as a standard argument. To capture a block and convert it into a `Proc` object that can be called, the parameter name in the method signature must be prefixed with an ampersand (`&`).

**Corrected Code:**

```ruby
def wrapper(&block) # Fix: use '&' to capture the block
  puts "Executing block now..."
  block.call
  puts "Block execution finished."
end

wrapper { puts "This is inside the block." }
```
