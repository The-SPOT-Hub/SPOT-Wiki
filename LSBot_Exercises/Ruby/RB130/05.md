## Problem 5: SEAT Testing Pattern

What does the acronym SEAT stand for in the context of writing tests, and what does each part represent?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

SEAT is a structured approach to writing tests that makes them clear, organized, and easy to understand.

- **S**et up: Prepare the necessary objects, variables, and state required for the test case.
- **E**xecute: Run the code or method that is being tested.
- **A**ssert: Verify that the outcome of the execution is what you expected. This is where you use assertion methods like `assert_equal`.
- **T**eardown: Clean up any resources created during the set-up phase. This is crucial for tests that interact with files, databases, or network connections to ensure that tests are independent and do not affect each other.
