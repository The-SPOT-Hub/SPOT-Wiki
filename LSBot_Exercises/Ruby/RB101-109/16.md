# Ruby 101-109
## Problem 16

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def test(b)
  b.map { |letter| "I like the letter: #{letter}" }
end

a = ['a', 'b', 'c']

test(a)
```

What is the value of `a`? What if we called `map!` instead of `map`?
