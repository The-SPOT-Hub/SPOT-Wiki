# Notes

Although this problem sounds simple, it contains an almost endless amount of edge cases. The other challenge of this problem is organizing an algorithm in a way that separates concerns and isn't repetitious. 

This problem is more involved than the assessment will be, but an excellent mental exercise for thinking outside the box and thinking out requirements.

Hint: Think about all the possible data types in an array, how each one should be "doubled", what you should do if the input isn't passed in through an array literal, and how to handle values such as 'undefined', etc.
