# Kahoot! trivia games
- **Info:**
    - All the games have between 5-11 questions. If you have a big group it's better to take short ones. We usually were able to do two games.
    - Between each question there is a perfect opportunity to discuss the answers, and ask additional questions.
    - if you have people in a group who never played before you can run test game to let everyone to get a feel of the game:

    We are going to play a KAHOOT! trivia game. For that the best is to have a computer screen and a mobile phone. If you cannot have that set up just let me know.

    This is a link to [Repl.it](http://repl.it/) / coderpad (in case we will need to test some code during the game)
    /paste repl or codepad link here /
    
    How do we play?
    
    1. On your mobile go to: [https://kahoot.it/](https://kahoot.it/)
    2. Enter a PIN number that I will share with you later
    3. I will share a screen via google meets
    4. On the shared screen you will be able to see the questions. There will be 4 answers to choose from and only one is correct
    5. There is a time limit to answer the questions (depending on a question anything between 20sec and 1min)
    6. On your mobile phone after entering PIN you will be able to see four squares corresponding to answer possibilities.
    7. After each question we will have a short discussin about the asnwers where you will be able to practice your code presentation
    
    Please note:
    
    - We will have a test game in the beginning
    - We are playing for fun and to learn it's ok not to know the answer.
    - Questions might be tricky.
    - I prepare all the questions by meself. Although with best intention I'm also still a learner and can make mistakes sometimes. Please let me know if any of the questions doesn't make sense or you think it may contain a mistake. I appreciate all the feedback!
    - We will have lots of fun :)
