### Description

Meant for a large study session. This exercise should consume the entire session.

Each student works on their function independently.

After most are complete (around the 20 or 30 min mark) those who have completed their solution are asked to describe their code out loud. 

If a student is confident in their solution, the student who wrote the code is responsible for answering any questions other students might have about its implementation.

If a student quickly finishes their function for the original solution, I suggest they attempt the bonus question.

### Code

```jsx
/** Write a function which accomplishes what the string requests
 *   Your function should use the mechanism specifed (for, while, forEach, etc)
 *   Use the function name specified
 *   Log the result to the console
 */
const obj = { text: "Remove occurances of the letter e after the word 'letter' in this sentence" }
Object.freeze(obj);

/**
 * BONUS: 
 * A single function should satisfy the strings defined 'obj' and the bonus objects below
 * The function should only take a single argument of type object
 * The function should be able to accomidate any word between the single quotes
 */
const bonusObj1 = { text: "Remove occurances of the letter e after 'the' in this sentence" }
const bonusObj2 = { text: "The letter e should not appear after the word 'not' in this sentence" }
Object.freeze(bonusObj1);
Object.freeze(bonusObj2);

/** for loop - function name: forSolution */ 

/** while loop - function name: whileSolution */

/** do while loop - function name: doWhileSolution */

/** forEach iteration method  - function name: forEachSolution */

/** filter iteration method  - function name: 'filterSolution' */

// map iteration method

// reduce iteration method
```
