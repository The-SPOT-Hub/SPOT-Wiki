**Advice on explaining concepts to those in JS 101** 

Think in terms of analogies, diagrams, examples, plain English description and technical definition. 
This way that the analogy serves as a first exposure to the concept in terms they will have familiarity with. Diagrams if appropriate and can be visualised help paint that analogy differently. If the concept can be expressed in an example then can be a good additional take home. Examples not necessarily code based tend to be better for high level concepts, i.e. in regard to modelling something. Plain English descriptions can be challenging but focuses the mind to explain things in simple language if possible. Technical definitions are good places to hone in that terminology. Code examples round off the explanation. 

As an example

Expose students to many examples from simple to complex in order to understand complicated parts of JS.

For example. Understanding why map/filter works can be broken down into first explaining

1. How a function is declared. 
2. Passing arguments to a function 
3. First class nature of functions (that it can be passed into another function)
4. Example of a higher order function 
5. Understanding arrow functions syntax (Three different types of syntax)
6. A quick example of map say invoking map on an array of `[1,2,3]`
7. More complicated example of map
8. Consideration of map gotchas (What happens if you don't return any value within the callback ?)
9. Recognise the pattern of code where map can be used (a for loop iterating over the array with a  variable assigned to an empty array) when refactoring code.
10. Ability to write a succinct paragraph on how map works (no more than 5-10 lines long)

Reference to specific terminology where possible and make students aware that you consciously being specific about the terminology. 

The correct difference between parameter and argument for example. Truthiness and evaluate to true etc....
